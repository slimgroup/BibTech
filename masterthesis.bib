  title = {Estimation of Surface-free Data by Curvelet-domain Matched Filtering
	and Sparse Inversion},
  school = {University of British Columbia},
  year = {2010},
  type = {masters},
  abstract = {A recent robust multiple-elimination technique, based on the underlying
	principle that relates primary impulse response to total upgoing
	wavefield, tries to change the paradigm that sees surface-related
	multiples as noise that needs to be removed from the data prior to
	imaging. This technique, estimation of primaries by sparse inversion
	(EPSI), (van Groenestijn and Verschuur, 2009; Lin and Herrmann, 2009),
	proposes an inversion procedure during which the source function
	and surface- free impulse response are directly calculated from the
	upgoing wavefield using an alternating optimization procedure. EPSI
	hinges on a delicate interplay between surface-related multiples
	and pri- maries. Finite aperture and other imperfections may violate
	this relationship. In this thesis, we investigate how to make EPSI
	more robust by incorporating curvelet- domain matching in its formulation.
	Compared to surface-related multiple removal (SRME), where curvelet-domain
	matching was used successfully, incorporating this step has the additional
	advantage that matches multiples to multiples rather than predicated
	multiples to total data as in SRME.},

  title = {Seismic Data Processing with the Parallel Windowed Curvelet Transform
	Seismic Data Processing with the Parallel Windowed Curvelet Transform},
  school = {University of British Columbia},
  year = {2009},
  type = {masters},
  abstract = {The process of obtaining high quality seismic images is very challenging
	when exploring new areas that have high complexities. The to be processed
	seismic data comes from the field noisy and commonly incomplete.
	Recently, major advances were accomplished in the area of coherent
	noise removal, for example, Surface Related Multiple Elimination
	(SRME). Predictive multiple elimination methods, such as SRME, consist
	of two steps: The first step is the prediction step, in this step
	multiples are predicted from the seismic data. The second step is
	the separation step in which primary reflection and surface related
	multiples are separated, this involves predicted multiples from the
	first step to be matched
	with the true multiples in the data and eventually removed . A recent
	robust Bayesian wavefield separation method have been recently introduced
	to improve on the separation by matching methods. This method utilizes
	the effectiveness of using the multi scale and multi angular curvelet
	transform in processing seismic images. The method produced excellent
	results and improved multiple removal. A considerable problem in
	the seismic processing field is the fact that seismic data are large
	and require a correspondingly large memory size and processing time.
	The fact that curvelets are redundant also increases the need for
	large memory to process seismic data. In this thesis we propose a
	parallel approach based windowing operator that divides large seismic
	data into smaller more managable datasets that can fit in memory
	so that it is possible to apply the Bayesian separation pro- cess
	in parallel with minimal harm to the image quality and data integrity.
	However, by dividing the data, we introduce discontinuities. We take
	these discontinuities into account and compare two ways that different
	windows may communicate. The first method is to communicate edge
	information at only two steps, namely, data scattering and gathering
	processes while applying the multiple separation on each window separately.
	The second method is to define our windowing operator as a global
	operator, which exchanges window edge information at each forward
	and inverse curvelet transform. We discuss the trade off between
	the two methods trying to minimize complexity and I/O time spent
	in the process. We test our windowing operator on a seismic denoising
	problem and then apply the windowing operator on our sparse-domain
	Bayesian primary- multiple separation.},

  title = {Incoherent noise suppression and deconvolution using curvelet-domain
	sparsity},
  school = {University of British Columbia},
  year = {2009},
  type = {masters},
  abstract = {Curvelets are a recently introduced transform domain that belongs
	to a family of multiscale and also multidirectional data expansions.
	As such, curvelets can be applied to resolution of the issues of
	complicated seismic wavefronts. We make use of this multiscale, multidirectional
	and hence sparsifying ability of the curvelet transform to suppress
	incoherent noise from crustal data where the signal-to-noise ratio
	is low and to develop an improved deconvolution procedure. Incoherent
	noise present in seismic reflection data corrupts the quality of
	the signal and can often lead to misinterpretation. The curvelet
	domain lends itself particularly well for denoising because coherent
	seismic energy maps to a relatively small number of significant curvelet
	coefficents.},

  abstract = {The ability to efficiently and sparsely represent seismic data is
	becoming an increasingly important problem in geophysics. Over the
	last thirty years many transforms such as wavelets, curvelets, contourlets,
	surfacelets, shear- lets, and many other types of x-lets
	have been developed. Such transform were leveraged to resolve this
	issue of sparse representations. In this work we compare the properties
	of four of these commonly used transforms, namely the shift-invariant
	wavelets, complex wavelets, curvelets and surfacelets. We also explore
	the performance of these transforms for the problem of recov- ering
	seismic wavefields from incomplete measurements.},

  year = {2008},
  type = {masters},
  address = {Vancouver, BC Canada},
  abstract = {In this work, we present a new method for seismic waveform characterization,
	which is aimed at extracting detailed litho-stratigraphical information
	from seismic data. We attempt to estimate the lithological attributes
	from seismic data according to our parametric representation of stratigraphical
	horizons, where the parameter values provide us with a direct link
	to nature of lithological transitions. We test our method on a seismic
	dataset with a strong diagenetic transition (opal-A to opal-CT transition).
	Given some information from cutting samples of well, we use a percolation-based
	model to construct the elastic profile of lithological transitions.
	Our goal is to match parametric representation for the diagenetic
	transition in both real data and synthetic data given by these elastic
	profiles. This match may be interpreted as a well-seismic tie, which
	reveals lithological information about stratigraphical horizons.},

  title = {Seismic ground-roll separation using sparsity promoting l1 minimization},
  school = {The University of British Columbia},
  year = {2008},
  address = {Vancouver, BC Canada},
  month = {May},
  abstract = {The removal of coherent noise generated by surface waves in land based
	seismic is a prerequisite to imaging the subsurface. These surface
	waves, termed as ground roll, overlay important reflector information
	in both the t-x and f-k domains. Standard techniques of ground roll
	removal commonly alter reflector information as a consequence of
	the ground roll removal. We propose the combined use of the curvelet
	domain as a sparsifying basis in which to perform signal separation
	techniques that can preserve reflector informa- tion while increasing
	ground roll removal. We examine two signal separation techniques,
	a block-coordinate relaxation method and a Bayesian separation method.
	The derivations and background for both methods are presented and
	the parameter sensitivity is examined. Both methods are shown to
	be effective in certain situations regarding synthetic data and erroneous
	surface wave predictions. The block-coordinate relaxation method
	is shown to have ma jor weaknesses when dealing with seismic signal
	separation in the pres- ence of noise and with the production of
	artifacts and reflector degradation. The Bayesian separation method
	is shown to improve overall separation for both seismic and real
	data. The Bayesian separation scheme is used on a real data set with
	a surface wave prediction containing reflector information. It is
	shown to improve the signal separation by recovering reflector information
	while improving the surface wave removal. The abstract contains a
	separate real data example where both the block-coordinate relaxation
	method and the Bayesian separation method are compared. },

  title = {Seismic singularity characterization with redundant dictionaries},
  school = {The University of British Columbia},
  year = {2005},
  type = {masters},
  address = {Vancouver, BC Canada},
  abstract = {We consider seismic signals as a superposition of waveforms parameterized
	by their fractional- orders. Each waveform models the reflection
	of a seismic wave at a particular transition between two lithological
	layers in the subsurface. The location of the waveforms in the seismic
	signal corresponds to the depth of the transitions in the subsurface,
	whereas their fractional-order constitutes a measure of the sharpness
	of the transitions. By considering fractional-order tran- sitions,
	we generalize the zero-order transition model of the conventional
	deconvolution problem, and aim at capturing the different types of
	transitions. The goal is to delineate and characterize transitions
	from seismic signals by recovering the locations and fractional-orders
	of its corre- sponding waveforms. This problem has received increasing
	interest, and several methods have been proposed, including multi-
	and monoscale analysis based on Mallat{\textquoteright}s wavelet
	transform modulus maxima, and seismic atomic decomposition. We propose
	a new method based on a two-step approach, which divides the initial
	problem of delineating and characterizing transitions over the whole
	seismic signal, into two easier sub- problems. The algorithm first
	partitions the seismic signal into its ma jor components, and then
	estimates the fractional-orders and locations of each component.
	Both steps are based on the sparse decomposition of seismic signals
	in overcomplete dictionaries of waveforms parameter- ized by their
	fractional-orders, and involve  1 minimizations solved by an iterative
	thresholding algorithm. We present the method and show numerical
	results on both synthetic and real data.},
