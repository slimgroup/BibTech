  YEAR = 2005,
  ABSTRACT = {We propose an efficient iterative data interpolation method using continuity along reflectors in seismic images via curvelet and discrete cosine transforms. The curvelet transform is a new multiscale transform that provides sparse representations for images that comprise smooth objects separated by piece-wise smooth discontinuities (e.g. seismic images). The advantage of using curvelets is that these frames are sparse for high-frequency caustic-free solutions of the wave-equation. Since we are dealing with less than ideal data (e.g. bandwidth-limited), we compliment the curvelet frames with the discrete cosine transform. The latter is motivated by the successful data continuation with the discrete Fourier transform. By choosing generic basis functions we circumvent the necessity to make parametric assumptions (e.g. through linear/parabolic Radon or demigration) regarding the shape of events in seismic data. Simulation and real data example demonstrate that our algorithm provides interpolated traces that accurately reproduce the wavelet shape as well as the AVO behavior on shot gathers.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two complementary solution strategies to the least-squares migration problem with sparseness- & continuity constraints are proposed. The applied formalism explores the sparseness of curvelets on the reflectivity and their invariance under the demigration migration operator. Sparseness is enhanced by (approximately) minimizing a (weighted)  {$l^{1}$}-norm on the curvelet coefficients. Continuity along imaged reflectors is brought out by minimizing the anisotropic difussion or total variation norm which penalizes variations along and in between reflectors. A brief sketch of the theory is provided as well as a number of synthetic examples. Technical details on the implementation of the optimization strategies are deferred to an accompanying paper: implementation.},

The solution is calculated using a combination of a Newton method and a Quasi-Newton method (Limited memory BFGS (LBFGS)). For numerical efficiency, a Lanczos decomposition for the normal operator is computed to replace the normal operator. This significantly reduces the computation time making the non-convex optimization feasible.},

  ABSTRACT = {A non-linear primary-multiple separation method using curvelets frames is presented. The advantage of this method is that curvelets arguably provide an optimal sparse representation for both primaries and multiples. As such curvelets frames are ideal candidates to separate primaries from multiples given inaccurate predictions for these two data components. The method derives its robustness regarding the presence of noise; errors in the prediction and missing data from the curvelet frame's ability (i) to represent both signal components with a limited number of multi-scale and directional basis functions; (ii) to separate the components on the basis of differences in location, orientation and scales and (iii) to minimize correlations between the coefficients of the two components.
