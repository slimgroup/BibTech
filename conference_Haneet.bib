	properties of the Earth{\textquoteright}s subsurface. Using the high-frequency
	ray-Born approximation for scattering from non-intersecting smooth
	interfaces, seismic data can be represented by a generalized Radon
	transform mapping the singularities in the medium to seismic data.
	Even though seismic data are bandwidth limited, signatures of the
	singularities in the medium carry through this transform and its
	inverse and this mapping property presents us with the possibility
	to develop new imaging techniques that preserve and characterize
	the singularities from incomplete, bandwidth-limited and noisy data.
	In this paper we propose a non-adaptive Curvelet/Contourlet technique
	to image and preserve the singularities and a data-adaptive Matching
	Pursuit method to characterize these imaged singularities by Multi-fractional
	Splines. This first technique borrows from the ideas within the Wavelet-Vaguelette/Quasi-SVD
	approach. We use the almost diagonalization of the scattering operator
	to approximately compensate for (i) the coloring of the noise and
	hence facilitate estimation; (ii) the normal operator itself. Results
	of applying these techniques to seismic imaging are encouraging although
	many open fundamental questions remain.},
