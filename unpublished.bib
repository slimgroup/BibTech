  title = {Modified {Gauss}-{Newton} full-waveform inversion explained—why sparsity-promoting updates do matter},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion can be formulated as a nonlinear
                  least-squares optimization problem. This non-convex
                  problem can be extremely computationally expensive
                  because it requires repeatedly solving large linear
                  systems that correspond to discretized partial
                  differential equations. Randomized subsampling
                  techniques allow us to work with small subsets of
                  (monochromatic) source experiments, reducing the
                  computational cost. However, this subsampling
                  weakens subsurface illumination and introduces
                  subsampling related incoherent artifacts. These
                  subsampling-related artifacts---in conjunction with
                  local minima that are known to plague full-waveform
                  inversion---motivate us to come up with a technique
                  to "regularize" this problem. Following earlier
                  work, we take advantage of the fact that curvelets
                  represent subsurface models and perturbations
                  parsimoniously. At first impulse promoting sparsity
                  on the model directly seems the most natural way to
                  proceed, but we will demonstrate that in certain
                  cases it can be advantageous to promote sparsity on
                  the Gauss-Newton updates instead. While constraining
                  the one-norm of the descent directions does not
                  change not change the underlying full-waveform
                  inversion objective, the constrained model updates
                  remain descent directions, remove
                  subsampling-related artifacts and improve the
                  overall inversion result. We empirically observe
                  this phenomenon in situations where the different
                  model updates occur at roughly the same locations in
                  the curvelet domain. We further investigate and
                  analyze this phenomenon, where nonlinear inversions
                  benefit from sparsity-promoting constraints on the
                  updates, by means of a set of carefully selected
                  examples including phase retrieval and full-waveform
                  inversion. In all cases, we observe a faster decay
                  of the residual and model error as a function of the
                  number of iterations.},

  title = {Estimation of primaries by sparse inversion with scattering-based multiple predictions for data with large gaps},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {We propose to solve the Estimation of Primaries by
                  Sparse Inversion problem without any explicit data
                  reconstruction, from a seismic record with missing
                  near-offsets and large holes in the acquisition grid
                  which does not produce aliasing but otherwise causes
                  large errors in the multiple prediction. Exclusion
                  of the unknown data as an inversion variable from
                  the process is desirable, since it sidesteps
                  possible issues arising from fitting observations
                  that are also unknowns in the same inversion
                  problem. Instead, we simulate their multiple
                  contributions by augmenting the forward prediction
                  model for the total wavefield with a scattering
                  series that mimics the action of the free surface
                  reflector within the confines of the unobserved
                  trace locations. Each term in this scattering series
                  simply involves convolution of the predicted
                  wavefield once more with the current estimated
                  surface-free Green's function at these unobserved
                  locations. We investigate the necessary
                  modifications to the primary estimation algorithm to
                  account for the resulting nonlinearity in the
                  modeling operator, and also demonstrate that just a
                  few scattering terms are enough to satisfactorily
                  mitigate the effects of near-offset data gaps during
                  the inversion process. Numerical experiments on
                  synthetic data show that the final derived method
                  can significantly outperform explicit data
                  reconstruction for large near-offset gaps. This is
                  achieved with a similar computational cost and
                  better memory efficiency compared to explicit data
                  reconstruction. We also show on real data that our
                  scheme outperforms pre-interpolation of the
                  near-offset gap.},

  title = {Off the grid low rank matrix recovery},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Matrix sensing and matrix completion problems capitalize
                  on the knowledge that a data matrix of interest
                  exhibits low rank properties. This low dimensional
                  structure often arises because the data matrix is
                  obtained by sampling a smooth function on a regular
                  (or structured) grid. However, in many practical
                  situations the measurements are taken on an
                  irregular grid (that is completely known). This
                  results in an ``unstructured data matrix'' that is
                  less fit for the low rank model in comparison to its
                  regular counterpart. In this paper we propose and
                  analyze a modified low rank matrix recovery workflow
                  that admits unstructured observations. By
                  incorporating a regularization operator which
                  accurately maps structured data to unstructured
                  data, into the nuclear norm minimization problem, we
                  are able to compensate for data irregularity.
                  Furthermore, by construction our formulation yields
                  output that is supported on a structured grid, so
                  that in effect we also regularize the data
                  matrix. We establish recovery error bounds for our
                  methodology and offer several matrix sensing and
                  matrix completion numerical experiments including
                  applications to frugal seismic data acquisition to
                  demonstrate the potential of the approach.},

  title = {Source estimation with surface-related multiples---fast ambiguity-resolved seismic imaging},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {We address the problem of obtaining a reliable seismic
                  image without prior knowledge of the source wavelet,
                  especially from data that contain strong
                  surface-related multiples. Conventional reverse-time
                  migration requires prior knowledge of the source
                  wavelet, which is either technically or
                  computationally challenging to accurately determine;
                  inaccurate estimates of the source wavelet can
                  result in seriously degraded reverse-time migrated
                  images, and therefore wrong geological
                  interpretations. To solve this problem, we present a
                  "wavelet-free" imaging procedure that simultaneously
                  inverts for the source wavelet and the seismic
                  image, by tightly integrating source estimation into
                  a fast least-squares imaging framework, namely
                  compressive imaging, given a reasonably accurate
                  background velocity model. However, this joint
                  inversion problem is difficult to solve as it is
                  plagued with local minima and the ambiguity with
                  respect to amplitude scalings, because of the
                  multiplicative, and therefore nonlinear, appearance
                  of the source wavelet in the otherwise linear
                  formalism. We have found a way to solve this
                  nonlinear joint-inversion problem using a technique
                  called variable projection, and a way to overcome
                  the scaling ambiguity by including surface-related
                  multiples in our imaging procedure following recent
                  developments in surface-related multiple prediction
                  by sparse inversion. As a result, we obtain without
                  prior knowledge of the source wavelet
                  high-resolution seismic images, comparable in
                  quality to images obtained assuming the true source
                  wavelet is known. By leveraging the computationally
                  efficient compressive-imaging methodology, these
                  results are obtained at affordable computational
                  costs compared with conventional processing work
                  flows that include surface-related multiple removal
                  and reverse-time migration.},

  title = {Enabling affordable omnidirectional subsurface extended image volumes via probing},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Image gathers as a function of subsurface offset are an
                  important tool for the inference of rock properties
                  and velocity analysis in areas of complex
                  geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of
                  as multidimensional correlations of the source and
                  receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing
                  these gathers lies in the fact that one needs to
                  store, compute, and correlate these wavefields for
                  all shots in order to obtain the desired image
                  gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically
                  only computed for a limited number of subsurface
                  points and for a limited range of subsurface
                  offsets, which may cause problems in complex
                  geological areas with large geologic dips. We
                  overcome increasing computational and storage costs
                  of extended image volumes by introducing a
                  formulation that avoids explicit storage and removes
                  the customary and expensive loop over shots, found
                  in conventional extended imaging. As a result, we
                  end up with a matrix-vector formulation from which
                  different image gathers can be formed and with which
                  amplitude-versus-angle and wave-equation migration
                  velocity analyses can be performed without requiring
                  prior information on the geologic dips. Aside from
                  demonstrating the formation of two-way extended
                  image gathers for different purposes and at greatly
                  reduced costs, we also present a new approach to
                  conduct automatic wave-equation based
                  migration-velocity analysis. Instead of focussing in
                  particular offset directions and preselected subsets
                  of subsurface points, our method focuses every
                  subsurface point for all subsurface offset
                  directions using a randomized probing technique. As
                  a consequence, we obtain good velocity models at low
                  cost for complex models without the need to provide
                  information on the geologic dips.},

  title = {Compressive 4D—economic time-lapse seismic with randomized subsampling and joint recovery},
  year = {2014},
  month = {10},
  abstract = {The current paradigm of time-lapse seismic relies on
                  dense sampling and repeatability amongst the
                  baseline and the monitor surveys. Recent results in
                  distributed compressive sensing allow us to come up
                  with a new economic sampling paradigm where the
                  vintages and time-lapse difference are recovered
                  from incomplete data. The combination of randomized
                  sampling, signal structure and correlations among
                  the vintages underlies this approach. In a somewhat
                  idealized setting where effects such as difference
                  in currents are ignored, and where we do not have
                  access to dense samplings of the baseline and/or
                  monitor surveys, we can get high quality recovery of
                  these vintages and time-lapse difference when there
                  is a small “overlap” in the surveys—i.e., where the
                  random samplings have partial statistical
                  dependence. Specifically, we find that the quality
                  of the vintages improves for decreasing overlap in
                  the surveys while the converse is true for the
                  time-lapse difference. Our setting differs from
                  conventional time-lapse acquisition because we do
                  not have access to dense samplings. Surveys with
                  partial overlapping randomized samplings lead to the
                  best trade-off between the recovery quality of the
                  vintages and the time-lapse signal. We confirm this
                  by a series of experiments.},
