  abstract = {In this work, we develop an optimization framework for
                  problems whose solutions are well-approximated by
                  Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensors, an efficient
                  structured tensor format based on recursive subspace
                  factor- izations. By exploiting the smooth manifold
                  structure of these tensors, we construct standard
                  optimization algorithms such as Steepest Descent and
                  Conjugate Gradient for completing tensors from
                  missing entries. Our algorithmic framework is fast
                  and scalable to large problem sizes as we do not
                  require SVDs on the ambient tensor space, as
                  required by other methods. Moreover, we exploit the
                  structure of the Gramian matrices associated with
                  the HT format, which reduces overfitting for high
                  subsampling ratios. We also find that the
                  organization of the tensor can have a major impact
                  on completion from realistic seismic acquisition
                  geometries. These samplings are far from idealized
                  randomized samplings that are usually
                  considered. Using these algorithms, we get good
                  performance on large-scale problems.},

  title    = {Frugal full-waveform inversion: from theory to a practical algorithm},
  year     = {2013},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {As conventional oil and gas fields are maturing, our
                  profession is challenged to come up with the
                  next-generation of more and more sophisticated
                  exploration tools. In exploration seismology this
                  trend has led to the emergence of wave-equation
                  based inversion technologies such as reverse-time
                  migration and full-waveform inversion. While
                  significant progress has been made in wave-equation
                  based inversion, major challenges remain in the
                  development of robust and computationally feasible
                  workflows that give reliable results in
                  geophysically challenging areas that may include
                  ultra-low shear velocity zones or high-velocity
                  salt. Moreover, sub-salt production carries risks
                  that needs mitigation, which raises the bar from
                  creating sub-salt images to inverting for sub-salt
                  overpressure. Amongst the many challenges that
                  wave-equation based inversion faces, we focus in
                  this contribution on reducing the excessive
                  computational costs of full-waveform inversion
                  (FWI). We accomplish these cost reductions by using
                  modern techniques from machine learning and
                  compressive sensing. Contrary to many
                  implementations of wave-equation based inversion, we
                  propose a methodology where we do not insist on
                  using all data—i.e., looping over all sources, to
                  calculate the velocity model updates. Instead, we
                  rely on a formulation that only calls for more data
                  and more accuracy in the wave simulations as needed
                  by the inversion. This leads to major savings in
                  particular in the beginning when we are far from the
                  solution. Since this approach reduces the
                  computational costs significantly, we open the way
                  to test different scenarios or to include more
                  sophisticated regularization. Without this cost
                  reduction, these would both be computationally
                  infeasible. The paper is organized as
                  follows. First, we introduce the basics of
                  full-waveform inversion, followed by stochastic
                  sampling techniques to reduce the computational
                  costs. Next, we propose an adaptive scheme that
                  selects the required sample size–i.e, the number of
                  source experiments that partake in the inversion,
                  and forward modeling accuracy. Recent results on the
                  Chevron Gulf of Mexico dataset are discussed next
                  followed by a discussion on challenges of FWI and
                  possible roads ahead.},

  title    = {Mitigating local minima in full-waveform inversion by expanding the search space},
  year     = {2013},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {Wave-equation based inversions, such as full-waveform
                  inversion, are challenging because of their
                  computational costs, memory requirements, and
                  reliance on accurate initial models. To confront
                  these issues, we propose a novel formulation of
                  full-waveform inversion based on a penalty
                  method. In this formulation, the objective function
                  consists of a data-misfit term and a penalty term
                  which measures how accurately the wavefields satisfy
                  the wave-equation. Because we carry out the
                  inversion over a larger search space, including both
                  the model and synthetic wavefields, our approach
                  suffers less from local minima. Our main
                  contribution is the development of an efficient
                  optimization scheme that avoids having to store and
                  update the wavefields by explicit
                  elimination. Compared to existing optimization
                  strategies for full-waveform inversion, our method
                  differers in two main aspects; i. The wavefields are
                  solved from an augmented wave-equation, where the
                  solution is forced to solve the wave-equation and
                  fit the observed data, ii. no adjoint wavefields are
                  required to update the model, which leads to
                  significant computational savings. We demonstrate
                  the validity of our approach by carefully selected
                  examples and discuss possible extensions and future
                  research.},

  abstract = {We present a method for solving PDE constrained
                  optimization problems based on a penalty
                  formulation. This method aims to combine advantages
                  of both full-space and reduced methods by exploiting
                  a large search-space (consisting of both control and
                  state variables) while allowing for an efficient
                  implementation that avoids storing and updating the
                  state-variables. This leads to a method that has
                  roughly the same per-iteration complexity as
                  conventional reduced approaches while dening an
                  objective that is less non-linear in the control
                  variable by implicitly relaxing the constraint. We
                  apply the method to a seismic inverse problem where
                  it leads to a particularly ecient implementation
                  when compared to a conventional reduced approach as

                  approach and suggest that the proposed formulation
                  can indeed mitigate some of the well-known problems
                  with local minima in the seismic inverse problem.},

  title    = {3D frequency-domain seismic inversion using a row-projected helmholtz solver},
  year     = {2013},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion aims at obtaining detailed
                  estimates of subsurface medium parameters, such as
                  soundspeed, from seismic data. A formulation in the
                  frequency-domain leads to an optimization problem
                  constrained by a Helmholtz equation with many
                  right-hand-sides. Application of this technique in
                  3D precludes the use of factorization techniques to
                  solve the Helmholtz equation due the large number of
                  gridpoints and the bandwidth of the matrix. While
                  more attractive from the perspective of memory use,
                  the computations costs of iterative methods scale
                  linearly with the number of right-hand-sides. Many
                  sophisticated preconditioned iterative techniques
                  have been developed for the Helmholtz equation,
                  however, they often include model-specific tuning
                  parameters and are thus not very attractive for
                  inversion since the medium parameters change from
                  one iteration to the next. In this paper, we propose
                  a method for 3D seismic waveform inversion that
                  addresses both the need to efficiently solve the
                  Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost
                  induced by the many right-hand-sides. To solve the
                  Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic
                  preconditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is
                  well-suited for inversion because of its
                  robustness. We extend this method to a
                  block-iterative method that can efficiently handle
                  multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the
                  computational cost of of the overall optimization
                  procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from
                  stochastic optimization that allow us to work with
                  approximate gradient information. These
                  approximations are obtained by evaluating only a
                  small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by
                  solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics
                  to adaptively determine the required accuracy of the
                  PDE solves and the sample-size and illustrate the
                  algorithms on synthetic benchmark models.},

  title = {A robust SVD-free approach to matrix completion, with applications to interpolation of large scale data},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Recent SVD-free matrix factorization formulations have
                  enabled rank minimization for systems with millions
                  of rows and columns, paving the way for matrix
                  completion in extremely large-scale applications,
                  such as seismic data interpolation. In this paper,
                  we consider matrix completion formulations designed
                  to hit a target data-fitting error level provided by
                  the user, and propose an algorithm that is able to
                  exploit factorized formulations to solve the
                  corresponding optimization problem. Since
                  practitioners typically have strong prior knowledge
                  about target error level, this innovation makes it
                  easy to apply the algorithm in practice, leaving
                  only the factor rank to be determined. We explore
                  the role that rank of the factors plays in our
                  formulation, and show that rank can be easily
                  adjusted as the inversion proceeds. Within the
                  established framework, we then propose two
                  extensions that are highly relevant to solving
                  practical challenges of data interpolation. First,
                  we propose a weighted extension that allows known
                  subspace information to improve the results of
                  matrix completion formulations. We show how this
                  weighting can be used in the context of frequency
                  continuation, an essential aspect to seismic data
                  interpolation. Second, we extend matrix completion
                  formulations to be extremely robust to large
                  measurement errors in the available data. We
                  illustrate the advantages of the basic approach on
                  the Netflix Prize problem using the Movielens (1M)
                  dataset. Then, we use the new method, along with its
                  robust and subspace re-weighted extensions, to
                  obtain high-quality reconstructions for large scale
                  seismic interpolation problems with real data, even
                  in the presence of extreme data contamination.},
