Year={2011},
Abstract={In this paper, we offer an alternative sampling method leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing towards seismic acquisition and processing for data that are traditionally considered to be undersampled. The main outcome of this approach is a new technology where acquisition and processing related costs are no longer determined by overly stringent sampling criteria, such as Nyquist. At the heart of our approach lies randomized incoherent sampling that breaks subsampling related interferences by turning them into harmless noise, which we subsequently remove by promoting transform-domain sparsity. Now, costs no longer grow with resolution and dimensionality of the survey area, but instead depend on transform-domain sparsity only. Our contribution is twofold. First, we demonstrate by means of carefully designed numerical experiments that compressive sensing can successfully be adapted to seismic acquisition. Second, we show that accurate recovery can be accomplished for compressively sampled data volumes sizes that exceed the size of conventional transform-domain data volumes by only a small factor. Because compressive sensing combines transformation and encoding by a single linear encoding step, this technology is directly applicable to acquisition and to dimensionality reduction during processing. In either case, sampling, storage, and processing costs scale with transform-domain sparsity. We illustrate this principle by means of number of case studies. },

@unpublished{Aravkin12ICASSPfastseis,
Abstract = {Seismic imaging can be formulated as a linear inverse problem where a medium perturbation is obtained via minimization of a least-squares misfit functional. The demand for higher resolution images in more geophysically complex areas drives the need to develop techniques that handle problems of tremendous size with limited computational resources. While seismic imaging is amenable to dimensionality reduction techniques that collapse the data volume into a smaller set of “super-shots”, these techniques break down for complex acquisition geometries such as marine acquisition, where sources and receivers move during acquisition. To meet these challenges, we propose a novel method that combines sparsity-promoting (SP) solvers with random sub- set selection of sequential shots, yielding a SP algorithm that only ever sees a small portion of the full data, enabling its application to very large-scale problems. Application of this technique yields excellent results for a complicated synthetic, which underscores the robustness of sparsity promotion and its suitability for seismic imaging.},

@unpublished{Mansour12ICASSadapt,
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an adaptive compressed sensing scheme that utilizes a support estimate to focus the measurements on the large valued coefficients of a compressible signal. We embed a “sparse-filtering” stage into the measure- ment matrix by weighting down the contribution of signal coefficients that are outside the support estimate. We present an application which can benefit from the proposed sampling scheme, namely, video compressive acquisition. We demonstrate that our proposed adaptive CS scheme results in a significant improvement in reconstruction quality compared with standard CS as well as adaptive recovery using weighted $\ell$1 minimization.},

@unpublished{Mansour12ICASSsupport,
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a support driven reweighted $\ell$_￿1 minimization algorithm (SDRL1) that solves a sequence of weighted $\ell$_￿1 problems and relies on the support estimate accu- racy. Our SDRL1 algorithm is related to the IRL1 algorithm proposed by Cande`s, Wakin, and Boyd. We demonstrate that it is sufficient to find support estimates with good accuracy and apply constant weights instead of using the inverse coefficient magnitudes to achieve gains similar to those of IRL1. We then prove that given a support estimate with sufficient accuracy, if the signal decays according to a specific rate, the solution to the weighted ￿1 minimization problem results in a support estimate with higher accuracy than the initial estimate. We also show that under certain conditions, it is possible to achieve higher estimate accuracy when the inter- section of support estimates is considered. We demonstrate the performance of SDRL1 through numerical simulations and compare it with that of IRL1 and standard ￿$\ell$_￿1 minimization.},
