  abstract = {In this work we propose a stochastic quasi-Newton Markov
                  chain Monte Carlo (McMC) method to quantify the
                  uncertainty of full-waveform inversion (FWI). We
                  formulate the uncertainty quantification problem in
                  the framework of the Bayesian inference, which
                  formulates the posterior probability as the
                  conditional probability of the model given the
                  observed data. The Metropolis-Hasting algorithm is
                  used to generate samples satisfying the posterior
                  probability density function (pdf) to quantify the
                  uncertainty. However it suffers from the challenge
                  to construct a proposal distribution that
                  simultaneously provides a good representation of the
                  true posterior pdf and is easy to manipulate. To
                  address this challenge, we propose a stochastic
                  quasi-Newton McMC method, which relies on the fact
                  that the Hessian of the deterministic problem is
                  equivalent to the inverse of the covariance matrix
                  of the posterior pdf. The l-BFGS (limited-memory
                  Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) Hessian is used to
                  approximate the inverse of the covariance matrix
                  efficiently, and the randomized source sub-sampling
                  strategy is used to reduce the computational cost of
                  evaluating the posterior pdf and constructing the
                  l-BFGS Hessian. Numerical experiments show the
                  capability of this stochastic quasi-Newton McMC
                  method to quantify the uncertainty of FWI with a
                  considerable low cost.},

                  processing algorithms that attempt to address some
                  of the current 4D challenges, in particular, imaging
                  weak 4D signals. Recent developments from the field
                  of compressive sensing have shown the benefits of
                  variants of randomized sampling in marine seismic
                  acquisition and its impact for the future of seismic
                  exploration. Following these developments, we show

                  provided we solve a sparsity-promoting convex

                  time-lapse data that has been acquired with
                  different source/receiver geometries, paving the way
                  for an efficient approach to dealing with time-lapse

  abstract = {Multi-Parameter full-waveform inversion is a challenging
                  problem, because the unknown parameters appear in
                  the same wave equation and the magnitude of the
                  parameters can vary many orders of magnitude. This
                  makes accurate estimation of multiple-parameters
                  very difficult. To mitigate the problems, sequential
                  strategies, regularization methods and scalings of
                  gradients and quasi-Newton Hessians have been
                  proposed. All of these require design, fine-tuning
                  and adaptation to different waveform inversion
                  problems. We propose to use a sparse approximation
                  to the Hessian derived from a penalty-formulation of
                  the objective function. Sparseness allows to have
                  the Hessian in memory and compute update directions
                  at very low cost. This results in decent

                  periodically, but seismic data are typically
                  irregularly sampled along spatial axes. Other than

                  deployed at different depths (over/under

  title = {Fast imaging with surface-related multiples by sparse inversion},
  year = {2014},
  month = {04},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {In marine exploration seismology, surface-related
                  multiples are usually treated as noise mainly
                  because subsequent processing steps, such as
                  migration-velocity analysis and imaging, require
                  multiple-free data. Failure to remove these
                  wavefield components from the data may lead to
                  erroneous estimates for migration velocity or result
                  in strong coherent artifacts that interfere with the
                  imaged reflectors. On the other hand, multiples
                  interact with the free surface and are therefore
                  exposed more to the subsurface. Hence, multiples
                  carry complementary information compared to the
                  primaries and when processed correctly improve the
                  illumination. Given a sufficiently accurate
                  background velocity model and an estimate for the
                  source signature, we propose a wave-equation based
                  inversion procedure that produces accurate images of
                  velocity perturbations in the subsurface from the
                  total upgoing wavefield including surface-related
                  multiples. Because our method uses subsampling
                  techniques, we obtain high-quality true-amplitude
                  least-squares migrated images at computational costs
                  of roughly a single reverse-time migration with
                  fully sampled data. We also incur a minimal overhead
                  from incorporating the multiples by having the
                  wave-equation solver carry out the
                  multiple-predictions via the inclusion of an areal
                  source. Our method derives its efficacy from
                  promoting curvelet-domain sparsity in the imaged
                  domain and leads to images that are virtually free
                  of artifacts from data that includes multiples. The

  title = {{3D} frequency-domain seismic inversion with controlled sloppiness},
  year = {2014},
  month = {03},
  abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion aims at obtaining detailed
                  estimates of subsurface medium parameters, such as
                  the spatial distribution of soundspeed, from
                  multi-experiment seismic data. A formulation of this
                  inverse problem in the frequency-domain leads to an
                  optimization problem constrained by a Helmholtz
                  equation with many right-hand-sides. Application of
                  this technique to industry-scale problem faces
                  several challenges: Firstly, we need to solve the
                  Helmholtz equation for high wavenumbers over large
                  computational domains. Secondly, the data consists
                  of many independent experiments, leading to a large
                  number of PDE-solves. This results in high
                  computational complexity both in terms of memory and
                  CPU time as well as i/o costs. Finally, the inverse
                  problem is highly non-linear and a lot of art goes
                  into preprocessing and regularization. Ideally, an
                  inversion needs to be run several times with
                  different initial guesses and/or tuning
                  parameters. In this paper, we discuss the
                  requirements of the various components (PDE-solver,
                  optimization method, ...) when applied to
                  large-scale 3D seismic waveform inversion and
                  combine several existing approaches into a flexible
                  inversion scheme for seismic waveform inversion. The
                  scheme is based on the idea that in the early stages
                  of the inversion we do not need all the data or very
                  accurate PDE-solves. We base our method on an
                  existing preconditioned Krylov solver (CARP-CG) and
                  use ideas from stochastic optimization to formulate
                  a gradient-based (Quasi-Newton) optimization
                  algorithm that works with small subsets of the
                  right-hand-sides and uses inexact PDE solves for the
                  gradient calculations. We proposed novel heuristics
                  to adaptively control both the accuracy and the
                  number of right-hand-sides. We illustrate the
                  algorithms on synthetic benchmark models for which
                  significant computational gains can be made without
                  being sensitive to noise and without loosing
                  accuracy of the inverted model.},

                  formulation. This method aims to combine advantages
                  of both full-space and reduced methods by exploiting
                  a large search-space (consisting of both control and
                  state variables) while allowing for an efficient
                  implementation that avoids storing and updating the
                  state-variables. This leads to a method that has
                  roughly the same per-iteration complexity as
                  conventional reduced approaches while dening an
                  objective that is less non-linear in the control
                  variable by implicitly relaxing the constraint. We

  title = {Fast methods for denoising matrix completion formulations, with application to robust seismic data interpolation},
  year = {2013},
  month = {05},
  abstract = {Recent SVD-free matrix factorization formulations have
                  enabled rank minimization for systems with millions
                  of rows and columns, paving the way for matrix
                  completion in extremely large-scale applications,
                  such as seismic data interpolation. In this paper,
                  we consider matrix completion formulations designed
                  to hit a target data-fitting error level provided by
                  the user, and propose an algorithm called LR-BPDN
                  that is able to exploit factorized formulations to
                  solve the corresponding optimization problem. Since
                  practitioners typically have strong prior knowledge
                  about target error level, this innovation makes it
                  easy to apply the algorithm in practice, leaving
                  only the factor rank to be determined.  Within the
                  established framework, we propose two extensions
                  that are highly relevant to solving practical
                  challenges of data interpolation. First, we propose
                  a weighted extension that allows known subspace
                  information to improve the results of matrix
                  completion formulations. We show how this weighting
                  can be used in the context of frequency
                  continuation, an essential aspect to seismic data
                  interpolation. Second, we propose matrix completion
                  formulations that are robust to large measurement
                  errors in the available data. We illustrate the
                  advantages of LR-BPDN on the collaborative filtering
                  problem using the MovieLens 1M, 10M, and Netflix
                  100M datasets. Then, we use the new method, along
                  with its robust and subspace re-weighted extensions,
                  to obtain high-quality reconstructions for large
                  scale seismic interpolation problems with real data,
                  even in the presence of data contamination.},

  abstract = {Data-driven methods---such as the estimation of
                  primaries by sparse inversion---suffer from the
                  `curse of dimensionality' that leads to
                  disproportional growth in computational and storage
                  demands when moving to realistic 3D field data. To
                  remove this fundamental impediment, we propose a
                  dimensionality-reduction technique where the `data
                  matrix' is approximated adaptively by a randomized
                  low-rank factorization. Compared to conventional
                  methods, which need for each iteration passage
                  through all data possibly requiring on-the-fly
                  interpolation, our randomized approach has the
                  advantage that the total number of passes is reduced
                  to only one to three. In addition, the low-rank
                  matrix factorization leads to considerable
                  reductions in storage and computational costs of the
                  matrix multiplies required by the sparse inversion.

                  wavefields. While transform-domain sparsity
                  promotion has proven to be an effective tool to
                  solve this recovery problem, current recovery
                  techniques make no use of a priori information on
                  the locations of transform-domain coefficients. In
                  this paper, we propose recovery by weighted one-norm
                  minimization, which exploits correlations between
                  the locations of significant coefficients of
                  different partitions, e.g., shot records,
                  common-offset gathers, or frequency slices of the

                  exploit 3D continuity exhibited by seismic
                  wavefields without relying on the highly redundant
