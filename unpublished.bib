  title    = {Fast solution of time-harmonic wave-equation for Full-Waveform Inversion},
  year     = {2014},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {For many full-waveform inversion techniques, the most
                  computationally intensive step is the computation of
                  a numerical solution for the wave equation on every
                  iteration. In the frequency domain approach, this
                  requires the solution of very large, complex,
                  sparse, ill-conditioned linear systems. In this
                  extended abstract we bring out attention
                  specifically to CGMN method for solving PDEs, known
                  for being flexible (i.e. it is able to treat equally
                  acoustic data as well as visco-elastic or more
                  complex scenarios) efficient with respect both to
                  memory and computation time, and controllable
                  accuracy of the final approximation. We propose an
                  improvement for the known CGMN method by imposing a
                  minimal residual condition, which incurs in one
                  extra model vector storage.  The resulting algorithm
                  called CRMN enjoys several interesting properties as
                  monotonically nonincreasing behaviour of the norm of
                  the residual and minimal residual, guaranteeing
                  optimal convergence for the relative residual
                  criterion.  We discuss numerical experiments both in
                  an isolated PDE solve and also within the inversion
                  procedure, showing that in a realistic scenario we
                  can expect a speedup around 25\% when using CRMN
                  rather than CGMN.},

  abstract = {In this work, we develop an optimization framework for
                  problems whose solutions are well-approximated by
                  Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensors, an efficient
                  structured tensor format based on recursive subspace
                  factor- izations. By exploiting the smooth manifold
                  structure of these tensors, we construct standard
                  optimization algorithms such as Steepest Descent and
                  Conjugate Gradient for completing tensors from
                  missing entries. Our algorithmic framework is fast
                  and scalable to large problem sizes as we do not
                  require SVDs on the ambient tensor space, as
                  required by other methods. Moreover, we exploit the
                  structure of the Gramian matrices associated with
                  the HT format, which reduces overfitting for high
                  subsampling ratios. We also find that the
                  organization of the tensor can have a major impact
                  on completion from realistic seismic acquisition
                  geometries. These samplings are far from idealized
                  randomized samplings that are usually
                  considered. Using these algorithms, we get good
                  performance on large-scale problems.},

  title    = {A penalty method for PDE-constrained optimization},
  year     = {2013},

  abstract = {We present a method for solving PDE constrained
                  optimization problems based on a penalty
                  formulation. This method aims to combine advantages
                  of both full-space and reduced methods by exploiting
                  a large search-space (consisting of both control and
                  state variables) while allowing for an efficient
                  implementation that avoids storing and updating the
                  state-variables. This leads to a method that has
                  roughly the same per-iteration complexity as
                  conventional reduced approaches while dening an
                  objective that is less non-linear in the control
                  variable by implicitly relaxing the constraint. We
                  apply the method to a seismic inverse problem where
                  it leads to a particularly ecient implementation
                  when compared to a conventional reduced approach as
                  it avoids the use of adjoint
                  state-variables. Numerical examples illustrate the
                  approach and suggest that the proposed formulation
                  can indeed mitigate some of the well-known problems

  title    = {3D frequency-domain seismic inversion using a row-projected helmholtz solver},
  year     = {2013},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion aims at obtaining detailed
                  estimates of subsurface medium parameters, such as
                  soundspeed, from seismic data. A formulation in the
                  frequency-domain leads to an optimization problem
                  constrained by a Helmholtz equation with many
                  right-hand-sides. Application of this technique in
                  3D precludes the use of factorization techniques to
                  solve the Helmholtz equation due the large number of
                  gridpoints and the bandwidth of the matrix. While
                  more attractive from the perspective of memory use,
                  the computations costs of iterative methods scale
                  linearly with the number of right-hand-sides. Many
                  sophisticated preconditioned iterative techniques
                  have been developed for the Helmholtz equation,
                  however, they often include model-specific tuning
                  parameters and are thus not very attractive for
                  inversion since the medium parameters change from
                  one iteration to the next. In this paper, we propose
                  a method for 3D seismic waveform inversion that
                  addresses both the need to efficiently solve the
                  Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost
                  induced by the many right-hand-sides. To solve the
                  Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic
                  preconditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is
                  well-suited for inversion because of its
                  robustness. We extend this method to a
                  block-iterative method that can efficiently handle
                  multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the
                  computational cost of of the overall optimization
                  procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from
                  stochastic optimization that allow us to work with
                  approximate gradient information. These
                  approximations are obtained by evaluating only a
                  small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by
                  solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics
                  to adaptively determine the required accuracy of the
                  PDE solves and the sample-size and illustrate the
                  algorithms on synthetic benchmark models.},

  title = {Fast methods for denoising matrix completion formulations, with application to robust seismic data interpolation},
  year = {2013},
  month = {05},
  abstract = {Recent SVD-free matrix factorization formulations have
                  enabled rank minimization for systems with millions
                  of rows and columns, paving the way for matrix
                  completion in extremely large-scale applications,
                  such as seismic data interpolation. In this paper,
                  we consider matrix completion formulations designed
                  to hit a target data-fitting error level provided by
                  the user, and propose an algorithm called LR-BPDN
                  that is able to exploit factorized formulations to
                  solve the corresponding optimization problem. Since
                  practitioners typically have strong prior knowledge
                  about target error level, this innovation makes it
                  easy to apply the algorithm in practice, leaving
                  only the factor rank to be determined.  Within the
                  established framework, we propose two extensions
                  that are highly relevant to solving practical
                  challenges of data interpolation. First, we propose
                  a weighted extension that allows known subspace
                  information to improve the results of matrix
                  completion formulations. We show how this weighting
                  can be used in the context of frequency
                  continuation, an essential aspect to seismic data
                  interpolation. Second, we propose matrix completion
                  formulations that are robust to large measurement
                  errors in the available data.  We illustrate the
                  advantages of LR-BPDN on the collaborative filtering
                  problem using the MovieLens 1M, 10M, and Netflix
                  100M datasets. Then, we use the new method, along
                  with its robust and subspace re-weighted extensions,
                  to obtain high-quality reconstructions for large
                  scale seismic interpolation problems with real data,
                  even in the presence of data contamination.},

  abstract = {Data-driven methods---such as the estimation of primaries by sparse
	inversion---suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' that leads
	to disproportional growth in computational and storage demands when
	moving to realistic 3D field data. To remove this fundamental impediment,
	we propose a dimensionality-reduction technique where the 'data matrix'
	is approximated adaptively by a randomized low-rank factorization.
	Compared to conventional methods, which need for each iteration passage
	through all data possibly requiring on-the-fly interpolation, our
	randomized approach has the advantage that the total number of passes
	is reduced to only one to three. In addition, the low-rank matrix
	factorization leads to considerable reductions in storage and computational
	costs of the matrix multiplies required by the sparse inversion.
	Application of the proposed method to synthetic and real data shows
	that significant performance improvements in speed and memory use
	are achievable at a low computational up-front cost required by the
	low-rank factorization.},

	to define a sequence of 2D curvelet-based recovery problems that

	on the highly redundant 3D curvelet transform. To illustrate the
	performance of our weighted algorithm, we compare recoveries from
