  title = {Scaling through abstractions â€“ high-performance vectorial wave
simulations for seismic inversion with Devito},
  year = {2020},
  month = {4},
  abstract = {[Devito] is an open-source Python project based on domain-specific
language and compiler technology. Driven by the requirements of rapid HPC
applications development in exploration seismology, the language and compiler
have evolved significantly since inception. Sophisticated boundary
conditions, tensor contractions, sparse operations and features such as
staggered grids and sub-domains are all supported; operators of essentially
arbitrary complexity can be generated. To accommodate this flexibility whilst
ensuring performance, data dependency analysis is utilized to schedule loops
and detect computational-properties such as parallelism. In this article, the
generation and simulation of MPI-parallel propagators (along with their
adjoints) for the pseudo-acoustic wave-equation in tilted transverse
isotropic media and the elastic wave-equation are presented. Simulations are
carried out on industry scale synthetic models in a HPC Cloud system and
reach a performance of 28TFLOP/s, hence demonstrating Devito's suitability
for production-grade seismic inversion problems.},

  title = {Low-rank representation of omnidirectional subsurface extended image
volumes},
  year = {2020},
  month = {3},
  abstract = {Subsurface-offset gathers play an increasingly important role in seismic
imaging. These gathers are used during velocity model building and inversion
of rock properties from amplitude variations. While powerful, these gathers
come with high computational and storage demands to form and manipulate these
high dimensional objects. This explains why only limited numbers of image
gathers are computed over a limited offset range. We avoid these high costs
by working with highly compressed low-rank factorizations. We arrive at these
factorizations via a combination of probings with the double two-way wave
equation and randomized singular value decompositions. In turn, the resulting
factorizations give us access to all subsurface offsets without having to
form the full extended image volumes. The latter is computationally
prohibitive because extended image volumes are quadratic in image size. As a
result, we can easily handle situations where conventional horizontal offset
gathers are no longer focused. More importantly, the factorization also
provides a mechanism to use the invariance relation of extended image volumes
for velocity continuation. With this technique, extended image volumes for
one background velocity model can directly be mapped to those of another
background velocity model. Our low-rank factorization inherits this
invariance property so we incur factorization costs only once when examining
different imaging scenarios. Because all imaging experiments only involve the
factors, they are computationally cheap with costs that scale with the rank
of the factorization. We validate our methodology on 2D synthetics including
a challenging imaging example with salt. Our experiments show that our
low-rank factorization parameterizes extended image volumes naturally.
Instead of brute force explicit cross-correlations between shifted source and receiver
wavefields, our approach relies on the underlying linear-algebra structure
that enables us to work with these objects without incurring unfeasible
demands on computation and storage.},

  title = {Time-domain sparsity promoting least-squares reverse time migration
with source estimation},
  year = {2020},
  month = {2},
  abstract = {Least-squares reverse time migration is well-known for its capability to generate artifact-free true-amplitude subsurface images through fitting observed data in the least-squares sense. However, when applied to realistic imaging problems, this approach is faced with issues related to overfitting and excessive computational costs induced by many wave-equation solves. The fact that the source function is unknown complicates this situation even further. Motivated by recent results in stochastic optimization and transform-domain sparsity-promotion, we demonstrate that the computational costs of inversion can be reduced significantly while avoiding imaging artifacts and restoring amplitudes. While powerfull, these new approaches do require accurate information on the source-time function, which is often lacking. Without this information, the imaging quality deteriorates rapidly. We address this issue by presenting an approach where the source-time function is estimated on the fly through a technique known as variable projection. Aside from introducing negligible computational overhead, the proposed method is shown to perform well on imaging problems with noisy data and problems that involve complex settings such as salt. In either case, the presented method produces high resolution high-amplitude fidelity images including an estimates for the source-time function. In addition, due to its use of stochastic optimization, we arrive at these images at roughly one to two times the cost of conventional reverse time migration involving all data.},

  title = {ACCELERATING SPARSE RECOVERY BY REDUCING CHATTER},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Compressive Sensing has driven a resurgence of sparse recovery algorithms with
  l_1-norm minimization. While these minimizations are relatively well understood for small underdetermined, possibly inconsistent systems, their behavior for large over-determined and inconsistent systems has received much less attention. Specifically, we focus on large systems where computational restrictions call for algorithms that use randomized subsets of rows that are touched a limited number of times. In that regime, l_1-norm minimization algorithms exhibit unwanted fluctuations near the desired solution, and the Linear Bregman iterations are no exception. We explain this observed lack of performance in terms of chatter, a well-known phenomena observed in non-smooth dynamical systems, where intermediate solutions wander between different states stifling convergence. By identifying chatter as the culprit, we modify the Bregman iterations with chatter reducing adaptive element-wise step lengths in combination with potential support detection via threshold crossing. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on carefully selected stylized examples and a realistic seismic imaging problem involving millions of unknowns and matrix-free matrix-vector products that involve expensive wave-equation solves.},
