  title = {Automatic statics and residual statics correction with low-rank approximation},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Seismic data, mainly on land, suffers from long-wavelength statics
due to the laterally varying and heterogeneous nature of the near-surface
weathering layers. We propose an automatic, data-driven and computationally efficient
statics correction method based on low-rank approximation to correct for such
statics. The method does not require a model to estimate static time shifts,
which is the case for other static correction methods; rather it applies the
appropriate static corrections on the data such that it becomes low rank in a
certain domain. As of now, the method is applicable to data that has been
corrected for elevation statics. Due to the near-surface irregularities and
due to approximations used by static correction methods that lead to not fully
correcting for statics, an iterative residual statics correction becomes
necessary. Our proposed method corrects for residual statics without the
necessity of the surface consistency assumption and a multi-iterate process.
Additional benefits of the method include artifacts and noise suppression. We
demonstrate the successful application of our method on several synthetic
data examples.},

  title = {Decentralized full-waveform inversion},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {With the advent of efficient seismic data acquisition, we are
having a surplus of seismic data, which is improving the imaging of the earth using
full-waveform inversion. However, such inversion suffers from many issues,
including (i) substantial network waiting time due to repeated communications of
function and gradient values in the distributed environment, and (ii)
requirement of the sophisticated optimizer to solve an optimization problem
involving non-smooth regularizers. To circumvent these issues, we propose a
decentralized full-waveform inversion, a scheme where connected agents in a
network optimize their objectives locally while being in consensus. The
proposed formulation can be solved using the ADMM method efficiently. We demonstrate
using the standard marmousi model that such scheme can decouple the
regularization from data fitting and reduce the network waiting time.},

  title = {Compressed sensing based land simultaneous acquisition using encoded sweeps},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Simultaneous shooting methods using encoded sweeps can enhance the
productivity of land acquisition in situations where deployment of many
vibrators and larger receiver spread is not possible in the field due to
obstructions or permit limitations. However, the existing framework requires
shooting the full sequence of encoded sweeps on each shot point to
reconstruct the complete frequency bandwidth Green's function. Although this simultaneous
shooting method reduces the sweeping time vs conventional sequential
shooting, the gain in efficiency is limited. To further reduce the sweeping time, we
propose to acquire randomly selected subsets of the encoded sweeps sequences
followed by a rank-minimization based joint source separation and spectral
interpolation framework to reconstruct the full bandwidth deblended Green's
function. We demonstrate the advantages of proposed sampling and
reconstruction framework using a synthetic seismic line simulated using SEG-SEAM Phase II
land velocity and density model.},

  title = {Seismic data reconstruction with Generative Adversarial Networks},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {A main challenge in seismic imaging is acquiring densely sampled data. Compressed Sensing has provided theoretical foundations upon which desired sampling rate can be achieved by applying a sparsity promoting algorithm on sub-sampled data. The key point in successful recovery is to deploy a randomized sampling scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for fast and accurate reconstruction of heavily under-sampled seismic data, regardless of type of sampling. A neural network learns to do reconstruction directly from data via an adversarial process. Once trained, the reconstruction can be done by just feeding the frequency slice with missing data into the neural network. This adaptive nonlinear model makes the algorithm extremely flexible, applicable to data with arbitrarily type of sampling. With the assumption that we have access to training data, the quality of reconstructed slice is superior even for extremely low sampling rate (as low as 10%) due to the data-driven nature of the method.},

  title = { Uncertainty quantification for inverse problems with weak
{PDE}-constraints},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = { In a statistical inverse problem, the objective is a complete
              statistical description of unknown parameters from noisy observations in order to quantify uncertainties of the parameters of interest. We consider inverse problems with partial-differential-equation-constraints, which are applicable to
              a variety of seismic problems. Bayesian inference is one of the most widely-used approaches to precisely quantify statistics through a posterior distribution, incorporating uncertainties in observed data, modeling kernel, and prior knowledge of the parameters. Typically when formulating the posterior distribution, the partial-differential-equation-constraints are required to be exactly satisfied, resulting in a highly nonlinear forward map and a posterior distribution with many local maxima. These drawbacks make it difficult to find an appropriate approximation for the posterior distribution. Another complicating factor is that traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are known to converge slowly for realistically sized problems. In this work, we relax the partial-differential-equation-constraints by introducing an auxiliary variable, which allows for Gaussian deviations in the partial-differential-equations. Thus, we obtain a new bilinear posterior distribution consisting of both data and partial-differential-equation misfit terms. We illustrate that for a particular range of variance choices for the partial-differential-equation misfit term, the new posterior distribution has fewer modes and can be well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution, which can then be sampled in a straightforward manner. Since it is prohibitively expensive to explicitly construct the dense covariance matrix of the Gaussian approximation for intermediate to large-scale problems, we present a method to implicitly construct it, which enables efficient sampling. We apply this framework to two-dimensional seismic inverse problems with 1,800 and 92,455 unknown parameters. The results illustrate that our framework can produce comparable statistical quantities to those produced by conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo type methods while requiring far fewer partial-differential-equation solves, which are the main computational bottlenecks in these problems.},

  title = {A unified {2D/3D} large scale software environment for nonlinear inverse problems},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Large scale parameter estimation problems are some of
                  the most computationally demanding problems. An
                  academic researcher's domain-specific knowledge
                  often precludes that of software design, which
                  results in software frameworks for inversion that
                  are technically correct, but not scalable to
                  realistically-sized problems. On the other hand, the
                  computational demands of the problem for realistic
                  problems result in industrial codebases that are
                  geared solely for performance, rather than
                  comprehensibility or flexibility. We propose a new
                  software design that bridges the gap between these
                  two seemingly disparate worlds. A hierarchical and
                  modular design allows a user to delve into as much
                  detail as she desires, while using high performance
                  primitives at the lower levels. Our code has the
                  added benefit of actually reflecting the underlying
                  mathematics of the problem, which lowers the
                  cognitive load on user using it and reduces the
                  initial startup period before a researcher can be
                  fully productive. We also introduce a new
                  preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation that is
                  suitable for fault-tolerant distributed
                  systems. Numerical experiments on a variety of 2D
                  and 3D test problems demonstrate the effectiveness
                  of this approach on scaling algorithms from small to
                  large scale problems with minimal code changes.},

  title = {Source estimation for wavefield-reconstruction inversion},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Source estimation is essential to all the wave-equation-based seismic inversions, including full-waveform inversion and the recently proposed wavefield-reconstruction inversion. When the source estimation is inaccurate, errors will propagate into the predicted data and introduce additional data misfit. As a consequence, inversion results that minimize this data misfit may become erroneous. To mitigate the errors introduced by the incorrect and pre-estimated sources, an embedded procedure that updates sources along with medium parameters is necessary for the inversion. So far, such a procedure is still missing in the context of wavefield-reconstruction inversion, a method that is, in many situations, less prone to local minima related to the so-called cycle skipping, compared to full-waveform inversion through exact data-fitting. While wavefield-reconstruction inversion indeed helps to mitigate issues related to cycle skipping by extending the search space with wavefields as auxiliary variables, it relies on having access to the correct source functions. In this paper, we remove the requirement of having the accurate source functions by proposing a source estimation technique specifically designed for wavefield-reconstruction inversion. To achieve this task, we consider the source functions as unknown variables and arrive at an objective function that depends on the medium parameters, wavefields, and source functions. During each iteration, we apply the so-called variable projection method to simultaneously project out the source functions and wavefields. After the projection, we obtain a reduced objective function that only depends on the medium parameters and invert for the unknown medium parameters by minimizing this reduced objective. Numerical experiments illustrate that this approach can produce accurate estimates of the unknown medium parameters without any prior information of the source functions.},
