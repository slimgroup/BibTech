  title = {A unified {2D/3D} large scale software environment for nonlinear inverse problems},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Large scale parameter estimation problems are some of
                  the most computationally demanding problems. An
                  academic researcher's domain-specific knowledge
                  often precludes that of software design, which
                  results in software frameworks for inversion that
                  are technically correct, but not scalable to
                  realistically-sized problems. On the other hand, the
                  computational demands of the problem for realistic
                  problems result in industrial codebases that are
                  geared solely for performance, rather than
                  comprehensibility or flexibility. We propose a new
                  software design that bridges the gap between these
                  two seemingly disparate worlds. A hierarchical and
                  modular design allows a user to delve into as much
                  detail as she desires, while using high performance
                  primitives at the lower levels. Our code has the
                  added benefit of actually reflecting the underlying
                  mathematics of the problem, which lowers the
                  cognitive load on user using it and reduces the
                  initial startup period before a researcher can be
                  fully productive. We also introduce a new
                  preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation that is
                  suitable for fault-tolerant distributed
                  systems. Numerical experiments on a variety of 2D
                  and 3D test problems demonstrate the effectiveness
                  of this approach on scaling algorithms from small to
                  large scale problems with minimal code changes.},

  title = {Highly repeatable {3D} compressive full-azimuth towed-streamer time-lapse acquisition --- a numerical feasibility study at scale},
  year = {2017},
  month = {05},
  abstract = {Most conventional 3D time-lapse (or 4D) acquisitions are
                  ocean-bottom cable (OBC) or ocean-bottom node (OBN)
                  surveys since these surveys are relatively easy to
                  replicate compared to towed-streamer surveys. To
                  attain high degrees of repeatability, survey
                  replicability and dense periodic sampling has become
                  the norm for 4D surveys that renders this technology
                  expensive. Conventional towed-streamer acquisitions
                  suffer from limited illumination of subsurface due
                  to narrow azimuth. Although, acquisition techniques
                  such as multi-azimuth, wide-azimuth, rich-azimuth
                  acquisition, etc., have been developed to illuminate
                  the subsurface from all possible angles, these
                  techniques can be prohibitively expensive for
                  densely sampled surveys. This leads to uneven
                  sampling, i.e., dense receiver and coarse source
                  sampling or vice-versa, in order to make these
                  acquisitions more affordable. Motivated by the
                  design principles of Compressive Sensing (CS), we
                  acquire economic, randomly subsampled (or
                  compressive) and simultaneous towed-streamer
                  time-lapse data without the need of replicating the
                  surveys. We recover densely sampled time-lapse data
                  on one and the same periodic grid by using a
                  joint-recovery model (JRM) that exploits shared
                  information among different time-lapse recordings,
                  coupled with a computationally cheap and scalable
                  rank-minimization technique. The acquisition is low
                  cost since we have subsampled measurements (about
                  70\% subsampled), simulated with a simultaneous
                  long-offset acquisition configuration of two source
                  vessels travelling across a survey area at random
                  azimuths. We analyze the performance of our proposed
                  compressive acquisition and subsequent recovery
                  strategy by conducting a synthetic, at scale,
                  seismic experiment on a 3D time-lapse model
                  containing geological features such as channel
                  systems, dipping and faulted beds, unconformities
                  and a gas cloud. Our findings indicate that the
                  insistence on replicability between surveys and the
                  need for OBC/OBN 4D surveys can, perhaps, be
                  relaxed. Moreover, this is a natural next step
                  beyond the successful CS acquisition examples
                  discussed in this special issue.},

  title = {Highly repeatable time-lapse seismic with distributed {Compressive} {Sensing}---mitigating effects of calibration errors},
  year = {2017},
  month = {05},
  abstract = {Recently, we demonstrated that combining joint recovery
                  with low-cost non-replicated randomized sampling
                  tailored to time-lapse seismic can give us access to
                  high fidelity, highly repeatable, dense prestack
                  vintages, and high-grade time-lapse. To arrive at
                  this result, we assumed well-calibrated
                  surveys---i.e., we presumed accurate post-plot
                  source/receiver positions. Unfortunately, in
                  practice seismic surveys are prone to calibration
                  errors, which are unknown deviations between actual
                  and post-plot acquisition geometry. By means of
                  synthetic experiments, we analyze the possible
                  impact of these errors on vintages and on time-lapse
                  data obtained with our joint recovery model from
                  compressively sampled surveys. Supported by these
                  experiments, we demonstrate that highly repeatable
                  time-lapse vintages are attainable despite the
                  presence of unknown calibration errors in the
                  positions of the shots. We assess the repeatability
                  quantitatively for two scenarios by studying the
                  impact of calibration errors on conventional dense
                  but irregularly sampled surveys and on low-cost
                  compressed surveys. To separate time-lapse effects
                  from calibration issues, we consider the idealized
                  case where the subsurface remains unchanged and the
                  practical situation where time-lapse changes are
                  restricted to a subset of the data. In both cases,
                  the quality of the recovered vintages and time-lapse
                  decreases gracefully for low-cost compressed surveys
                  with increasing calibration errors. Conversely, the
                  quality of vintages from expensive densely
                  periodically sampled surveys decreases more rapidly
                  as unknown and difficult to control calibration
                  errors increase.},
