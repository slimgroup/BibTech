  title = {Combining checkpointing and data compression to accelerate adjoint-based optimization problems},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Seismic inversion and imaging are adjoint-based optimization problems that processes up to terabytes of data, regularly exceeding the memory capacity of available computers. Data compression is an effective strategy to reduce this memory requirement by a certain factor, particularly if some loss in accuracy is acceptable. A popular alternative is checkpointing, where data is stored at selected points in time, and values at other times are recomputed as needed from the last stored state. This allows arbitrarily large adjoint computations with limited memory, at the cost of additional recomputations. In this paper we combine compression and checkpointing for the first time to compute a realistic seismic inversion. The combination of checkpointing and compression allows larger adjoint computations compared to using only compression, and reduces the recomputation overhead significantly compared to using only checkpointing.},

  abstract = {We propose a ‘learned’ iterative solver for the Helmholtz equation, by combining traditional Krylov-based solvers with machine learning. The method is, in principle, able to circumvent the shortcomings of classical iterative solvers, and has clear advantages over purely data-driven ap- proaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach under a 1.5-D assumption, when ade- quate a priori information about the velocity distribution is known.},

  title = {Architecture and performance of Devito, a system for automated stencil computation},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Stencil computations are a key part of many high-performance computing applications, such as image processing, convolutional neural networks, and finite-difference solvers for partial differential equations. Devito is a framework capable of generating highly-optimized code given symbolic equations expressed in Python, specialized in, but not limited to, affine (stencil) codes. The lowering process – from mathematical equations down to C++ code – is
performed by the Devito compiler through a series of intermediate representations. Several performance optimizations are introduced, including advanced common sub-expressions elimination, tiling and parallelization. Some of these are obtained through well-established stencil optimizers, integrated in the back-end of the Devito compiler. The architecture of the Devito compiler, as well as the performance optimizations that are applied when generating code, are presented. The effectiveness of such performance optimizations is demonstrated using operators drawn from seismic imaging applications.},

  title = {Target-oriented imaging using extended image volumes—a low-rank factorization approach},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Imaging in geological challenging environments has led to new developments, including the idea of generating reflection responses by means of interferometric redatuming at a given target datum in the subsurface, when the target datum lies beneath a complex overburden. One way to perform this redatuming is via conventional model-based wave-equation techniques. But those techniques can be computationally expensive for large-scale seismic
problems since the number of wave-equation solves is equal to two-times the number of
sources involved during seismic data acquisition. Also conventional shot-profile
techniques require lots of memory to save full subsurface extended image volumes. Therefore,
they only form subsurface image volumes in either horizontal or vertical directions. We now present a
randomized singular value decomposition based approach built upon the matrix
probing scheme, which takes advantage of the algebraic structure of the extended
imaging system. This low-rank representation enables us to overcome both the computational
cost associated with the number of wave-equation solutions and memory usage due to explicit
storage of full subsurface extended image volumes employed by conventional migration
methods. Experimental results on complex geological models demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed methodology and allow practical reflection-based extended imaging for large-scale 5D seismic data.},

  title = {Devito: an embedded domain-specific language for finite differences and geophysical exploration},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {We introduce Devito, a new domain-specific language for implementing
high-performance finite difference partial differential equation solvers.
The motivating application is exploration seismology where methods such as
Full-Waveform Inversion and Reverse-Time Migration are used to
invert terabytes of seismic data to create images of the earth's
subsurface. Even using modern supercomputers, it can take weeks to process a
single seismic survey and create a useful subsurface image. The computational cost is dominated by the numerical solution of wave equations and their corresponding adjoints. Therefore, a great deal of effort is invested in aggressively optimizing the performance of these wave-equation propagators for different computer architectures. Additionally, the actual set of partial differential equations being solved and their numerical discretization is under constant innovation as increasingly realistic representations of the physics are developed, further ratcheting up the cost of practical solvers. By embedding a domain-specific language within Python and making heavy use of SymPy, a symbolic mathematics library, we make it possible to develop finite difference simulators quickly using a
syntax that strongly resembles the mathematics. The Devito compiler reads this code and applies a wide range of analysis to generate highly optimized and parallel code. This approach can reduce the development time of a verified and optimized solver from months to days.},

  title = {A large-scale framework for symbolic implementations of seismic inversion algorithms in Julia},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Writing software packages for seismic inversion is a very challenging task, since problems such as full-waveform inversion or least-squares imaging are both algorithmically and computationally demanding due to the large number of unknown parameters and the fact that we are propagating waves over many wavelengths. Software frameworks therefore need to combine both versatility and performance to provide geophysicists with the means and flexibility to implement complex algorithms that scale to exceedingly large 3D problems. Following these principles, we introduce the Julia Devito Inversion framework, an open-source software package in Julia for large-scale seismic modeling and inversion based on Devito, a domain-specific language compiler for automatic code generation. The framework consists of matrix-free linear operators for implementing seismic inversion algorithms that closely resembles the mathematical notation, a flexible resilient parallelization and an interface to Devito for generating optimized stencil code to solve the underlying wave equations. In comparison to many manually optimized industry codes written in low-level languages, our software is built on the idea of independent layers of abstractions and user interfaces with symbolic operators, making it possible to manage both the complexity of algorithms and performance optimizations, while preserving modularity, which allows for a level of expressiveness needed to formulate a broad range of wave-equation-based inversion problems. Through a series of numerical examples, we demonstrate that this allows users to implement algorithms for waveform inversion and imaging as simple Julia scripts that scale to large-scale 3D problems; thus providing a truly performant research and production framework.},

  title = {Compressive least-squares migration with on-the-fly Fourier transforms},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Least-squares reverse-time migration is a powerful approach for true amplitude seismic imaging of complex geological structures, but the successful application of this method is currently hindered by its enormous computational cost, as well as high memory requirements for computing the gradient of the objective function. We tackle these problems by introducing an algorithm for low-cost sparsity-promoting least-squares migration using on-the-fly Fourier transforms. We formulate the least-squares migration objective function in the frequency domain and compute gradients for randomized subsets of shot records and frequencies, thus significantly reducing data movement and the number of overall wave equations solves. By using on-the-fly Fourier transforms, we can compute an arbitrary number of monochromatic frequency-domain wavefields with a time-domain modeling code, instead of having to solve individual Helmholtz equations for each frequency, which quickly becomes computationally infeasible when moving to high frequencies. Our numerical examples demonstrate that compressive imaging with on-the-fly Fourier transforms provides a fast and memory-efficient alternative to time-domain imaging with optimal checkpointing, whose memory requirements for a fixed background model and source wavelet is independent of the number of time steps. Instead, memory and additional computational cost grow with the number of frequencies and determine the amount of subsampling artifacts and crosstalk. In contrast to optimal checkpointing, this offers the possibility to trade both memory and computational cost for image quality or a larger number of iterations and is advantageous in new computing environments such as the cloud, where compute is often cheaper than memory and data movement.},
