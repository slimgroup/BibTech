  title    = {Fast solution of time-harmonic wave-equation for Full-Waveform Inversion},
  year     = {2014},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {For many full-waveform inversion techniques, the most
                  computationally intensive step is the computation of
                  a numerical solution for the wave equation on every
                  iteration. In the frequency domain approach, this
                  requires the solution of very large, complex,
                  sparse, ill-conditioned linear systems. In this
                  extended abstract we bring out attention
                  specifically to CGMN method for solving PDEs, known
                  for being flexible (i.e. it is able to treat equally
                  acoustic data as well as visco-elastic or more
                  complex scenarios) efficient with respect both to
                  memory and computation time, and controllable
                  accuracy of the final approximation. We propose an
                  improvement for the known CGMN method by imposing a
                  minimal residual condition, which incurs in one
                  extra model vector storage.  The resulting algorithm
                  called CRMN enjoys several interesting properties as
                  monotonically nonincreasing behaviour of the norm of
                  the residual and minimal residual, guaranteeing
                  optimal convergence for the relative residual
                  criterion.  We discuss numerical experiments both in
                  an isolated PDE solve and also within the inversion
                  procedure, showing that in a realistic scenario we
                  can expect a speedup around 25\% when using CRMN
                  rather than CGMN.},

                  the technical challenges one faces in detecting
                  time-lapse signals. By using recent insights from
                  the field of compressive sensing, we show that the

                  long as we carry out a sparsitypromoting program
                  that exploits shared information between the
                  baseline and monitor surveys. By inverting for the
                  baseline and monitor survey as the common
                  "background", we are able to compute high-fidelity
                  4-D differences from carefully selected synthetic
                  surveys that have different sets of source/receivers

                  of an exciting new approach to randomized 4-D
                  acquisition where time-lapse signal can be computed

  year     = {2014},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {In this abstract, we extend our previous work in
                  Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor completion, which
                  uses an extremely efficient representation for
                  representing high-dimensional tensors exhibit- ing
                  low-rank structure, to handle subsampled tensors
                  with noisy entries. We consider a ’low-noise’ case,
                  so that the energies of the noise and the signal are
                  nearly indistinguishable, and a ’high-noise’ case,
                  in which the noise energy is now scaled to the
                  amplitude of the entire data volume. We exam- ine
                  the effect of the noise in terms of the singular
                  values along different matricizations of the data,
                  i.e.  reshaping of the tensor along different
                  modes. By interpreting this effect in the context of
                  tensor completion, we demonstrate the inefficacy of
                  denoising by this method in the source-receiver do-
                  main. In light of this observation, we transform the
                  decimated, noisy data in to the midpoint-offset
                  domain, which promotes low-rank behaviour in the
                  signal and high-rank behaviour in the noise.  This
                  distinction between signal and noise allows low-rank
                  interpolation to effectively denoise the signal with
                  only a marginal increase in computational cost. We
                  demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a

  title    = {Application of a convex phase retrieval method to blind seismic deconvolution},
  year     = {2014},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {A classical strategy for blind seismic deconvolution is
                  to first estimate the autocorrelation of the unknown
                  source wavelet from the data and then recover the
                  wavelet by assuming it has minimum phase. However,
                  computing the minimum phase wavelet directly from
                  the amplitude spectrum can be sensitive to even
                  extremely small errors, especially in the
                  coefficients close to zero. Since the minimum phase
                  requirement follows from an assumption that the
                  wavelet should be as impulsive as possible, we
                  propose to directly estimate an impulsive wavelet by
                  minimizing a weighted l2 penalty subject to a
                  constraint on its amplitude spectrum. This nonconvex
                  model has the form of a phase retrieval problem, in
                  this case recovering a signal given only estimates
                  of the magnitudes of its Fourier
                  coefficients. Following recent work on convex
                  relaxations of phase retrieval problems, we propose
                  a convex semidefinite program for computing an
                  impulsive minimum phase wavelet whose amplitude
                  spectrum is close to a given estimate, and we show
                  that this can be robustly solved by a Douglas
                  Rachford splitting method for convex optimization.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a method for computation of the

                  based on one-way wave equation. Our approach
                  involves factorization of the discretized Helmholtz
                  operator at each depth by extracting the matrix
                  square root after performing the spectral projector
                  in order to eliminate the evanescent modes. The
                  computation of the square root of the discrete
                  Helmholtz operator and its inverse is done using
                  polynomial recursions and can be combined with low

                  structure of the Gramian matrices associated with
                  the HT format, which reduces overfitting for high
                  subsampling ratios. We also find that the
                  organization of the tensor can have a major impact
                  on completion from realistic seismic acquisition
                  geometries. These samplings are far from idealized
                  randomized samplings that are usually
                  considered. Using these algorithms, we get good
                  performance on large-scale problems.},

  abstract = {We present a method for solving PDE constrained
                  optimization problems based on a penalty
                  formulation. This method aims to combine advantages
                  of both full-space and reduced methods by exploiting
                  a large search-space (consisting of both control and
                  state variables) while allowing for an efficient
                  implementation that avoids storing and updating the
                  state-variables. This leads to a method that has
                  roughly the same per-iteration complexity as
                  conventional reduced approaches while dening an
                  objective that is less non-linear in the control
                  variable by implicitly relaxing the constraint. We
                  apply the method to a seismic inverse problem where
                  it leads to a particularly ecient implementation
                  when compared to a conventional reduced approach as
                  it avoids the use of adjoint
                  state-variables. Numerical examples illustrate the
                  approach and suggest that the proposed formulation
                  can indeed mitigate some of the well-known problems
                  with local minima in the seismic inverse problem.},

  title    = {3D frequency-domain seismic inversion using a row-projected helmholtz solver},
  year     = {2013},
  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion aims at obtaining detailed
                  estimates of subsurface medium parameters, such as
                  soundspeed, from seismic data. A formulation in the
                  frequency-domain leads to an optimization problem
                  constrained by a Helmholtz equation with many
                  right-hand-sides. Application of this technique in
                  3D precludes the use of factorization techniques to
                  solve the Helmholtz equation due the large number of
                  gridpoints and the bandwidth of the matrix. While
                  more attractive from the perspective of memory use,
                  the computations costs of iterative methods scale
                  linearly with the number of right-hand-sides. Many
                  sophisticated preconditioned iterative techniques
                  have been developed for the Helmholtz equation,
                  however, they often include model-specific tuning
                  parameters and are thus not very attractive for
                  inversion since the medium parameters change from
                  one iteration to the next. In this paper, we propose
                  a method for 3D seismic waveform inversion that
                  addresses both the need to efficiently solve the
                  Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost
                  induced by the many right-hand-sides. To solve the
                  Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic
                  preconditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is
                  well-suited for inversion because of its
                  robustness. We extend this method to a
                  block-iterative method that can efficiently handle
                  multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the
                  computational cost of of the overall optimization
                  procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from
                  stochastic optimization that allow us to work with
                  approximate gradient information. These
                  approximations are obtained by evaluating only a
                  small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by
                  solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics
                  to adaptively determine the required accuracy of the
                  PDE solves and the sample-size and illustrate the
                  algorithms on synthetic benchmark models.},

  title = {A robust SVD-free approach to matrix completion, with applications to interpolation of large scale data},
  year = {2013},
  month = {05},
  abstract = {Recent SVD-free matrix factorization formulations have
                  enabled rank minimization for systems with millions
                  of rows and columns, paving the way for matrix
                  completion in extremely large-scale applications,
                  such as seismic data interpolation. In this paper,
                  we consider matrix completion formulations designed
                  to hit a target data-fitting error level provided by
                  the user, and propose an algorithm that is able to
                  exploit factorized formulations to solve the
                  corresponding optimization problem. Since
                  practitioners typically have strong prior knowledge
                  about target error level, this innovation makes it
                  easy to apply the algorithm in practice, leaving
                  only the factor rank to be determined. We explore
                  the role that rank of the factors plays in our
                  formulation, and show that rank can be easily
                  adjusted as the inversion proceeds. Within the
                  established framework, we then propose two
                  extensions that are highly relevant to solving
                  practical challenges of data interpolation. First,
                  we propose a weighted extension that allows known
                  subspace information to improve the results of
                  matrix completion formulations. We show how this
                  weighting can be used in the context of frequency
                  continuation, an essential aspect to seismic data
                  interpolation. Second, we extend matrix completion
                  formulations to be extremely robust to large
                  measurement errors in the available data. We
                  illustrate the advantages of the basic approach on
                  the Netflix Prize problem using the Movielens (1M)
                  dataset. Then, we use the new method, along with its
                  robust and subspace re-weighted extensions, to
                  obtain high-quality reconstructions for large scale
                  seismic interpolation problems with real data, even
                  in the presence of extreme data contamination.},

  abstract = {Data-driven methods---such as the estimation of primaries by sparse
	inversion---suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' that leads
	to disproportional growth in computational and storage demands when

	we propose a dimensionality-reduction technique where the 'data matrix'
	is approximated adaptively by a randomized low-rank factorization.
	Compared to conventional methods, which need for each iteration passage
	through all data possibly requiring on-the-fly interpolation, our
	randomized approach has the advantage that the total number of passes
	is reduced to only one to three. In addition, the low-rank matrix
	factorization leads to considerable reductions in storage and computational
	costs of the matrix multiplies required by the sparse inversion.
	Application of the proposed method to synthetic and real data shows
	that significant performance improvements in speed and memory use

	to define a sequence of 2D curvelet-based recovery problems that

	on the highly redundant 3D curvelet transform. To illustrate the
