  title = {Prediction of stratigraphic units from spectral co-occurance coefficients of well logs},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Well logging is the process of making physical
                  measurements down bore holes in order to
                  characterize geological and structural
                  properties. Logs are visually interpreted and
                  correlated to classify regions that are similar in
                  structure, a process that can be modelled with
                  machine learning. This project applies supervised
                  learning methods to labelled well logs from the
                  Trenton Black River data set in order to classify
                  major stratigraphic units. Spectral co-occurance
                  coefficients were used for feature extraction, and a
                  k-nearest-neighbours approach was used for
                  classification. This novel approach was applied to
                  real field data in a high-impact domain, yielding
                  promising results for future research.},

  title = {Off the grid tensor completion for seismic data interpolation},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {The practical realities of acquiring seismic data in a
                  realistic survey are often at odds with the
                  stringent requirements of Shannon-Nyquist-based
                  sampling theory. The unpredictable movement of the
                  ocean`s currents can be detrimental in acquiring
                  exactly equally-spaced samples while sampling at
                  Nyquist-rates are expensive, given the huge
                  dimensionality and size of the data volume. Recent
                  work in matrix and tensor completion for seismic
                  data interpolation aim to alleviate such stringent
                  Nyquist-based sampling requirements but are
                  fundamentally posed on a regularly-spaced grid. In
                  this work, we extend our previous results in using
                  the so-called Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor format
                  for recovering seismic data to the irregularly
                  sampled case. We introduce an interpolation operator
                  that resamples our tensor from a regular grid (in
                  which we impose our low-rank constraints) to our
                  irregular sampling grid. Our framework is very
                  flexible and efficient, depending primarily on the
                  computational costs of this operator. We demonstrate
                  the superiority of this approach on a realistic BG
                  data set compared to using low-rank tensor methods
                  that merely use binning.},

  title = {A lifted $\ell_1/\ell_2$ constraint for sparse blind deconvolution},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {We propose a modification to a sparsity constraint based
                  on the ratio of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms for
                  solving blind seismic deconvolution problems in
                  which the data consist of linear convolutions of
                  different sparse reflectivities with the same source
                  wavelet. We also extend the approach to the
                  Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (EPSI)
                  model, which includes surface related multiples.
                  Minimizing the ratio of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms
                  has been previously shown to promote sparsity in a
                  variety of applications including blind
                  deconvolution. Most existing implementations are
                  heuristic or require smoothing the $\ell_1/\ell_2$
                  penalty. Lifted versions of $\ell_1/\ell_2$
                  constraints have also been proposed but are
                  challenging to implement. Inspired by the lifting
                  approach, we propose to split the sparse signals
                  into positive and negative components and apply an
                  $\ell_1/\ell_2$ constraint to the difference,
                  thereby obtaining a constraint that is easy to
                  implement without smoothing the $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$
                  norms. We show that a method of multipliers
                  implementation of the resulting model can recover
                  source wavelets that are not necessarily minimum
                  phase and approximately reconstruct the sparse
                  reflectivities. Numerical experiments demonstrate
                  robustness to the initialization as well as to noise
                  in the data.},

                  Reconstruction Inversion has the advantage that the

                  reconstruction inversion also requires good source
                  wavelets. Without correct source wavelets,

  abstract = {Simultaneous marine acquisition is an economic way to
                  sample seismic data and speedup acquisition, wherein
                  single and/or multiple source vessels fire sources
                  at near-simultaneous or slightly random times,
                  resulting in overlapping shot records. The current
                  paradigm for simultaneous towed-streamer marine
                  acquisition incorporates "low-variability" in source
                  firing times---i.e., $\leq$ 1 or 2 seconds, since
                  both the sources and receivers are moving. This
                  results in low degree of randomness in simultaneous
                  data, which is challenging to separate (into its
                  constituent sources) using compressed sensing based
                  separation techniques since randomization is the key
                  to successful recovery via compressed sensing. In
                  this paper, we address the challenge of source
                  separation for simultaneous towed-streamer
                  acquisitions via two compressed sensing based
                  approaches---i.e., sparsity-promotion and

                  both the sparsity-promotion and rank-minimization
                  based techniques by simulating two simultaneous
                  towed-streamer acquisition scenarios---i.e.,
                  over/under and simultaneous long offset. We observe
                  that the proposed approaches give good and
                  comparable recovery qualities of the separated
                  sources, but the rank-minimization technique is
                  relatively faster and memory efficient. We also
                  compare these two techniques with the NMO-based

                  computed in reverse order during time stepping and
                  therefore requires storage or other type of
                  mitigation because storing the full time history of
                  the forward wavefield is too expensive in realistic
                  3D settings. To overcome this challenge, we propose
                  an approximate adjoint-state method where the
                  wavefields are subsampled randomly, which
                  drastically the amount of storage needed. By using
                  techniques from stochastic optimization, we control
                  the errors induced by the subsampling. Examples of
                  the proposed technique on a synthetic but realistic
                  2D model show that the subsampling-related artifacts
                  can be reduced significantly by changing the
                  sampling for each source after each model
                  update. Combination of this gradient approximation
                  with a quasi-Newton method shows virtually artifact
                  free inversion results requiring only 5% of storage
                  compared to saving the history at Nyquist. In
                  addition, we avoid having to recompute the
                  wavefields as is required by checkpointing.},

  abstract = {A framework is proposed for regularizing the waveform
                  inversion problem by projections onto intersections
                  of convex sets. Multiple pieces of prior information
                  about the geology are represented by multiple convex
                  sets, for example limits on the velocity or minimum
                  smoothness conditions on the model.  The data-misfit
                  is then minimized, such that the estimated model is
                  always in the intersection of the convex
                  sets. Therefore, it is clear what properties the
                  estimated model will have at each iteration. This
                  approach does not require any quadratic penalties to
                  be used and thus avoids the known problems and
                  limitations of those types of penalties. It is shown
                  that by formulating waveform inversion as a
                  constrained problem, regularization ideas such as
                  Tikhonov regularization and gradient filtering can
                  be incorporated into one framework. The algorithm is

                  with any (differentiable) objective function and
                  does not require significant additional
                  computation. The method is demonstrated on the

                  of model results that sit within multiple a priori
                  constraint sets. These constraints are imposed
                  through a Projected Quasi-Newton (PQN) approach,
                  wherein the projection set is the intersection of
                  physical property bounds and anisotropic wavenumber

                  constitute a significant portion of the acquired
                  data. Typically, multiples are removed during
                  early-stage data-processing as they can lead to
                  phantom reflectors during migration that may result
                  in erroneous geological interpretations. However, if
                  properly dealt with, multiples can provide valuable
                  extra information and complement primaries in
                  illuminating the subsurface. In this article, we
                  demonstrate the limitation of the reverse-time
                  migration in imaging these multiples, and present an
                  alternative inversion procedure that is
                  computationally efficient, that jointly maps both
                  primaries and multiples to the true reflectors, and
                  where the source function is estimated on the
                  fly. As a result, we obtain high-quality, mostly
                  artifact-free, broad-band images where the imprint

  abstract = {Many inverse and parameter estimation problems can be
                  written as PDE-constrained optimization
                  problems. The goal, then, is to infer the
                  parameters, typically coefficients of the PDE, from
                  partial measurements of the solutions of the PDE for
                  several right-hand-sides. Such PDE-constrained
                  problems can be solved by finding a stationary point
                  of the Lagrangian, which entails simultaneously
                  updating the parameters and the (adjoint) state
                  variables. For large-scale problems, such an
                  all-at-once approach is not feasible as it requires
                  storing all the state variables. In this case one
                  usually resorts to a reduced approach where the
                  constraints are explicitly eliminated (at each
                  iteration) by solving the PDEs. These two
                  approaches, and variations thereof, are the main
                  workhorses for solving PDE-constrained optimization
                  problems arising from inverse problems. In this
                  paper, we present an alternative method that aims to
                  combine the advantages of both approaches. Our
                  method is based on a quadratic penalty formulation
                  of the constrained optimization problem. By
                  eliminating the state variable, we develop an
                  efficient algorithm that has roughly the same
                  computational complexity as the conventional reduced
                  approach while exploiting a larger search
                  space. Numerical results show that this method
                  indeed reduces some of the non-linearity of the
                  problem and is less sensitive the initial iterate.},

                  data for key applications such as migration and
                  multiple prediction requiring densely sampled,
                  alias-free wide azimuth data. When seismic data is
                  organized in monochromatic frequency slices,
                  missing-trace interpolation can be cast into a
                  matrix completion problem, where the low-rank
                  structure of seismic data in the appropriate domain
                  can be exploited to recover densely sampled data
                  volumes from data with missing entries. Current
                  approaches that exploit low-rank structure are based
                  on repeated singular value decompositions, which
                  become prohibitively expensive for large-scale
                  problems unless the data is partitioned and
                  processed in small windows. While computationally
                  manageable, our theory and experiments show degraded
                  results when the windows sizes become too small. To
                  overcome this problem, we carry out our
                  interpolations for each frequency independently
                  while working with the complete data in the
                  midpoint-offset domain instead of windowing. For
                  lateral varying geologies that are not too complex,
                  working in the midpoint-offset domain leads to
                  favorable rank minimization recovery because the
                  singular values decay faster while sampling-related
                  artifacts remain full rank. This combination of fast
                  decay and full-rank artifacts agrees with the
                  principles of the compressive sensing paradigm,
                  which is based on exploiting (low-rank) structure, a
                  sampling process that breaks this structure, and a
                  rank-minimizing optimization that restores the
                  signal's structure and interpolates the subsampled
                  data. To make our proposed method computationally
                  viable and practical, we introduce a
                  factorization-based approach that avoids computing
                  the singular values, and that therefore scales to
                  large seismic data problems as long as the factors
                  can be stored in memory. Tests on realistic two- and
                  three-dimensional seismic data show that our method
                  compares favorably, both in terms of computational
                  speed and recovery quality, to existing
                  curvelet-based and tensor-based techniques.},

  abstract = {The current paradigm of time-lapse seismic relies on
                  dense sampling and repeatability amongst the
                  baseline and the monitor surveys. Recent results in
                  distributed compressive sensing allow us to come up
                  with a new economic sampling paradigm where the
                  vintages and time-lapse difference are recovered
                  from incomplete data. The combination of randomized
                  sampling, signal structure and correlations among
                  the vintages underlies this approach. In a somewhat
                  idealized setting where effects such as difference
                  in currents are ignored, and where we do not have
                  access to dense samplings of the baseline and/or
                  monitor surveys, we can get high quality recovery of
                  these vintages and time-lapse difference when there
                  is a small ‚Äúoverlap‚Äù in the surveys‚Äîi.e., where the
                  random samplings have partial statistical
                  dependence. Specifically, we find that the quality
                  of the vintages improves for decreasing overlap in
                  the surveys while the converse is true for the
                  time-lapse difference. Our setting differs from
                  conventional time-lapse acquisition because we do
                  not have access to dense samplings. Surveys with
                  partial overlapping randomized samplings lead to the
                  best trade-off between the recovery quality of the
                  vintages and the time-lapse signal. We confirm this
                  by a series of experiments.},

                  from compressed sensing measurements when partial
                  support in- formation is available. We show that
                  weighted $\ell_p$ minimization with 0 < p < 1 is stable
                  and robust under weaker sufficient conditions

                  sufficient recovery conditions of weighted $\ell_p$ are
                  weaker than those of regular $\ell_p$ minimization if at
