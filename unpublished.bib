  title = {Seismic waveform inversion using decomposed one-way wavefields},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Conventional seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) estimates a velocity model by matching the two-way predicted data with the observed data. The non-linearity of the problem and the complexity of the Earth's subsurface, which results in complex wave propagation may lead to unsatisfactory inversion results. Moreover, having inaccurate overburden models, i.e water velocity model in the ocean bottom acquisition setting, may lead to erroneous velocity models. In order to obtain better velocity models, we simplify the FWI problem by decomposing the total two-way observed and predicted wavefields into one-way wavefields at the receiver locations using acoustic wavefield decomposition. We then propose to fit the less-complex one-way wavefield to obtain a velocity model that contains valuable information about the overburden. We use this inverted velocity model as a better initial model for the inversion using the other more-complex one-way wavefield. We demonstrate our proposed algorithm on acoustic non-inverse crime synthetic data produced from the Marmousi2 model. The proposed method provides improved inversion results compared with conventional FWI due to properly accounting for separate model updates from the up- and down-going wavefields.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a non-linear procedure to es- timate subsurface rock parameters from surface measurements of induced seismic waves. This procedure is ill-posed in nature and hence, requires regularization to enhance some structure depending on the prior information. Recently, Total-variation (TV) regularization has gained popularity due to its ability to produce blocky structures. Contrary to this, the earth behave more like a piecewise smooth function. TV regularization fails to enforce this prior information into FWI. We propose a Mumford-Shah functional to incorporate the piecewise smooth spatial structure in the FWI procedure. The resulting opti- mization problem is solved by a splitting method. We show the improvement in results against TV regularization on two synthetic camembert examples.},

However, the twenty-one parameter complete wave-equation is too computationally expensive to be of use in this case. The transverse tilted isotropic wave-equation is then the next best feasible representation of the physics to use for imaging. The main complexity arising from transverse tilted isotropic imaging is to model the receiver wavefield (back propagation of the data or data residual) for the imaging condition. Unlike the isotropic or the full physics wave-equations, the transverse tilted isotropic wave-equation is not not self-adjoint. This difference means that time-reversal will not model the correct receiver wavefield and this can lead to incorrect subsurface images. In this work, we derive and implement the adjoint wave-equation to demonstrate the necessity of exact adjoint modeling for anisotropic modeling and compare our result with adjoint-free time-reversed imaging.},

In this work, we propose a denoising step in combination with a computationally cheap debiasing based approach to locate microseismic sources and to estimate their source-time functions with correct amplitude from extremely noisy data.

When the imaging step itself is not handled properly, this may possibly offset gains offered by deep learning. Motivated by our work on deep convolutional neural networks in seismic data reconstruction, we discuss how generative networks can be employed in prestack problems ranging from the relatively mondane removal of the effects of the free surface to dealing with the complex effects of numerical dispersion in time-domain finite differences. While the results we present are preliminary, there are strong indications that generative deep convolutional neural networks can have a major impact on complex tasks in prestack seismic data processing and modeling for inversion.},

In this work, we develop a matched-filter based LS-RTM for velocity-only Born modeling operator, which removes the artifacts in the imaging created by the strong density variation. This method doesn't call for extra work of finite difference stencil and is more general.

  abstract = {Seismic data, mainly on land, suffers from long-wavelength statics
due to the laterally varying and heterogeneous nature of the near-surface
weathering layers. We propose an automatic, data-driven and computationally efficient
statics correction method based on low-rank approximation to correct for such

which is the case for other static correction methods; rather it applies the
appropriate static corrections on the data such that it becomes low rank in a
certain domain. As of now, the method is applicable to data that has been
corrected for elevation statics. Due to the near-surface irregularities and
due to approximations used by static correction methods that lead to not fully
correcting for statics, an iterative residual statics correction becomes
necessary. Our proposed method corrects for residual statics without the
necessity of the surface consistency assumption and a multi-iterate process.
Additional benefits of the method include artifacts and noise suppression. We
demonstrate the successful application of our method on several synthetic
data examples.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Imaging in geological challenging environments has led to new developments, including the idea of generating reflection responses by means of interferometric redatuming at a given target datum in the subsurface, when the target datum lies beneath a complex overburden. One way to perform this redatuming is via conventional model-based wave-equation techniques. But those techniques can be computationally expensive for large-scale seismic
problems since the number of wave-equation solves is equal to two-times the number of
sources involved during seismic data acquisition. Also conventional shot-profile
techniques require lots of memory to save full subsurface extended image volumes. Therefore,
they only form subsurface image volumes in either horizontal or vertical directions. We now present a
randomized singular value decomposition based approach built upon the matrix
probing scheme, which takes advantage of the algebraic structure of the extended
imaging system. This low-rank representation enables us to overcome both the computational
cost associated with the number of wave-equation solutions and memory usage due to explicit
storage of full subsurface extended image volumes employed by conventional migration
methods. Experimental results on complex geological models demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed methodology and allow practical reflection-based extended imaging for large-scale 5D seismic data.},

  title = {Projection methods for nonlinear inverse problems with multiple constraints},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Nonlinear inverse problems are often hampered by non-uniqueness and local minima because of missing low frequencies and far offsets in the data, lack of access to good starting models, noise, and modeling errors. A well-known approach to counter these deficiencies is to include prior information on the unknown model, which regularizes the inverse problem. While conventional regularization methods have resulted in enormous progress in ill-posed (geophysical) inverse problems, challenges remain when the prior information consists of multiple pieces. To handle this situation, we propose an optimization framework that allows us to add multiple pieces of prior information in the form of constraints. Compared to additive regularization penalties, constraints have a number of advantages making them more suitable for inverse problems such as full-waveform inversion. The proposed framework is rigorous because it offers assurances that multiple constraints are imposed uniquely at each iteration, irrespective of the order in which they are invoked. To project onto the intersection of multiple sets uniquely, we employ Dykstra’s algorithm that scales to large problems and does not rely on trade-off parameters. In that sense, our approach differs substantially from approaches such as Tikhonov regularization, penalty methods, and gradient filtering. None of these offer assurances, which makes them less suitable to full-waveform inversion where unrealistic intermediate results effectively derail the iterative inversion process. By working with intersections of sets, we keep expensive objective and gradient calculations unaltered, separate from projections, and we also avoid trade-off parameters. These features allow for easy integration into existing code bases. In addition to more predictable behavior, working with constraints also allows for heuristics where we built up the complexity of the model gradually by relaxing the constraints. This strategy helps to avoid convergence to local minima that represent unrealistic models. We illustrate this unique feature with examples of varying complexity.},

  abstract = {A main challenge in seismic imaging is acquiring densely sampled data. Compressed Sensing has provided theoretical foundations upon which desired sampling rate can be achieved by applying a sparsity promoting algorithm on sub-sampled data. The key point in successful recovery is to deploy a randomized sampling scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for fast and accurate reconstruction of heavily under-sampled seismic data, regardless of type of sampling. A neural network learns to do reconstruction directly from data via an adversarial process. Once trained, the reconstruction can be done by just feeding the frequency slice with missing data into the neural network. This adaptive nonlinear model makes the algorithm extremely flexible, applicable to data with arbitrarily type of sampling. With the assumption that we have access to training data, the quality of reconstructed slice is superior even for extremely low sampling rate (as low as 10%) due to the data-driven nature of the method.},

  title = {Fast sparsity-promoting microseismic source inversion},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Microseismic events are generated during hydraulic fracturing of unconventional reservoirs and carry information on fracture locations and the origin times associated with these microseismic events. For drilling purposes and to prevent hazardous situations, we need to have accurate knowledge on the fracture locations as well as on their size, and their density. Because microseismic waves can travel far distances, microseismic data collected at the surface and or in boreholes can help us to monitor hydraulic fracturing. While so-called back propagation or time-reversal methods are able to focus recorded energy back onto the sources when a reasonable velocity model is available, these methods suffer from blurring especially in situations where the data acquisition suffers from lack of aperture, sparse sampling, and noise. As a result, these methods typically cannot resolve sources in close proximity, a desired feature since we need this information if we want to follow the fracture evolution in space and time. In that situation, we need to estimate the locations and the associated source-time functions for closely spaced microseismic sources along the active fractures. To overcome the limitations of time-reversal methods, we propose a wave-equation based inversion approach where we invert for the complete source wavefield in both space and time. By promoting sparsity on the source wavefield in space, we negate the effects of non-radiating sources during the inversion and obtain high-resolution intensity plots and high-fidelity estimates for the source-time functions. We obtain these results relatively fast by accelerating the linearized Bregman method with a dual formulation. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method is computationally feasible, robust to noise, and works for closely spaced sources with overlapping source-time functions in complex geological settings.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = { Conventional oil and gas fields are increasingly difficult to explore and image, resulting in the call for more complex wave-equation based inversion algorithms that require dense long-offset samplings. Consequently, there is an exponential growth in the size of data volumes and prohibitive demands on computational resources. In this work, we propose a method to compress and process seismic data directly in a low-rank tensor format, which drastically reduces the amount of storage required to represent the data. We first outline how seismic data exhibits low-rank structure in a particular transform-domain, which can be exploited to compress the dense data in one extremely storage-efficient tensor format when the data is fully sampled. In the more realistic case of missing data, we can use efficient interpolation techniques to approximate the fully sampled volume in compressed form. In either case, once we have our data represented in its compressed tensor form, we design an algorithm to extract source or receiver gathers directly from the compressed parameters. This extraction process can be done on-the-fly directly on the compressed data, in a full waveform inversion context, and does not require scanning through the entire dataset in order to form shot gathers. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first major contributions to working with seismic data applications directly in the compressed domain without reconstructing the entire data volume. We use a stochastic inversion approach, which works with small subsets of source experiments at each iteration, further reducing the computational and memory costs of full waveform inversion. We also demonstrate how this data compression and extraction technique can be applied to forming full subsurface image gathers through probing techniques.},

  abstract = {Writing software packages for seismic inversion is a very challenging task, since problems such as full-waveform inversion or least-squares imaging are both algorithmically and computationally demanding due to the large number of unknown parameters and the fact that we are propagating waves over many wavelengths. Software frameworks therefore need to combine both versatility and performance to provide geophysicists with the means and flexibility to implement complex algorithms that scale to exceedingly large 3D problems. Following these principles, we introduce the Julia Devito Inversion framework, an open-source software package in Julia for large-scale seismic modeling and inversion based on Devito, a domain-specific language compiler for automatic code generation. The framework consists of matrix-free linear operators for implementing seismic inversion algorithms that closely resembles the mathematical notation, a flexible resilient parallelization and an interface to Devito for generating optimized stencil code to solve the underlying wave equations. In comparison to many manually optimized industry codes written in low-level languages, our software is built on the idea of independent layers of abstractions and user interfaces with symbolic operators, making it possible to manage both the complexity of algorithms and performance optimizations, while preserving modularity, which allows for a level of expressiveness needed to formulate a broad range of wave-equation-based inversion problems. Through a series of numerical examples, we demonstrate that this allows users to implement algorithms for waveform inversion and imaging as simple Julia scripts that scale to large-scale 3D problems; thus providing a truly performant research and production framework.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = { In a statistical inverse problem, the objective is a complete
              statistical description of unknown parameters from noisy observations in order to quantify uncertainties of the parameters of interest. We consider inverse problems with partial-differential-equation-constraints, which are applicable to
              a variety of seismic problems. Bayesian inference is one of the most widely-used approaches to precisely quantify statistics through a posterior distribution, incorporating uncertainties in observed data, modeling kernel, and prior knowledge of the parameters. Typically when formulating the posterior distribution, the partial-differential-equation-constraints are required to be exactly satisfied, resulting in a highly nonlinear forward map and a posterior distribution with many local maxima. These drawbacks make it difficult to find an appropriate approximation for the posterior distribution. Another complicating factor is that traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are known to converge slowly for realistically sized problems. In this work, we relax the partial-differential-equation-constraints by introducing an auxiliary variable, which allows for Gaussian deviations in the partial-differential-equations. Thus, we obtain a new bilinear posterior distribution consisting of both data and partial-differential-equation misfit terms. We illustrate that for a particular range of variance choices for the partial-differential-equation misfit term, the new posterior distribution has fewer modes and can be well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution, which can then be sampled in a straightforward manner. Since it is prohibitively expensive to explicitly construct the dense covariance matrix of the Gaussian approximation for intermediate to large-scale problems, we present a method to implicitly construct it, which enables efficient sampling. We apply this framework to two-dimensional seismic inverse problems with 1,800 and 92,455 unknown parameters. The results illustrate that our framework can produce comparable statistical quantities to those produced by conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo type methods while requiring far fewer partial-differential-equation solves, which are the main computational bottlenecks in these problems.},

                  added benefit of actually reflecting the underlying
                  mathematics of the problem, which lowers the
                  cognitive load on user using it and reduces the
                  initial startup period before a researcher can be
                  fully productive. We also introduce a new
                  preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation that is
                  suitable for fault-tolerant distributed
                  systems. Numerical experiments on a variety of 2D
                  and 3D test problems demonstrate the effectiveness
                  of this approach on scaling algorithms from small to
                  large scale problems with minimal code changes.},

  title = {Source estimation for wavefield-reconstruction inversion},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Source estimation is essential to all the wave-equation-based seismic inversions, including full-waveform inversion and the recently proposed wavefield-reconstruction inversion. When the source estimation is inaccurate, errors will propagate into the predicted data and introduce additional data misfit. As a consequence, inversion results that minimize this data misfit may become erroneous. To mitigate the errors introduced by the incorrect and pre-estimated sources, an embedded procedure that updates sources along with medium parameters is necessary for the inversion. So far, such a procedure is still missing in the context of wavefield-reconstruction inversion, a method that is, in many situations, less prone to local minima related to the so-called cycle skipping, compared to full-waveform inversion through exact data-fitting. While wavefield-reconstruction inversion indeed helps to mitigate issues related to cycle skipping by extending the search space with wavefields as auxiliary variables, it relies on having access to the correct source functions. In this paper, we remove the requirement of having the accurate source functions by proposing a source estimation technique specifically designed for wavefield-reconstruction inversion. To achieve this task, we consider the source functions as unknown variables and arrive at an objective function that depends on the medium parameters, wavefields, and source functions. During each iteration, we apply the so-called variable projection method to simultaneously project out the source functions and wavefields. After the projection, we obtain a reduced objective function that only depends on the medium parameters and invert for the unknown medium parameters by minimizing this reduced objective. Numerical experiments illustrate that this approach can produce accurate estimates of the unknown medium parameters without any prior information of the source functions.},
