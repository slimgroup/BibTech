  abstract = {In this paper, we offer an alternative sampling method leveraging
	recent insights from compressive sensing towards seismic acquisition
	and processing for data that are traditionally considered to be undersampled.
	The main outcome of this approach is a new technology where acquisition
	and processing related costs are no longer determined by overly stringent
	sampling criteria, such as Nyquist. At the heart of our approach
	lies randomized incoherent sampling that breaks subsampling related
	interferences by turning them into harmless noise, which we subsequently
	remove by promoting transform-domain sparsity. Now, costs no longer
	grow with resolution and dimensionality of the survey area, but instead
	depend on transform-domain sparsity only. Our contribution is twofold.
	First, we demonstrate by means of carefully designed numerical experiments
	that compressive sensing can successfully be adapted to seismic acquisition.
	Second, we show that accurate recovery can be accomplished for compressively
	sampled data volumes sizes that exceed the size of conventional transform-domain
	data volumes by only a small factor. Because compressive sensing
	combines transformation and encoding by a single linear encoding
	step, this technology is directly applicable to acquisition and to
	dimensionality reduction during processing. In either case, sampling,
	storage, and processing costs scale with transform-domain sparsity.
	We illustrate this principle by means of number of case studies.},
