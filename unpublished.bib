  title = {Simultaneous-shot inversion for PDE-constrained optimization problems with missing data},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Stochastic optimization is key to efficient inversion in
PDE-constrained optimization. Using `simultaneous shots', or random
superposition of source terms, works very well in simple acquisition
geometries where all sources see all receivers, but this rarely occurs in practice. We
develop an approach that interpolates data to an ideal acquisition geometry
while solving the inverse problem using simultaneous shots. The approach is
formulated as a joint inverse problem, combining ideas from low-rank
interpolation with full-waveform inversion. Results using synthetic
experiments illustrate the flexibility and efficiency of the approach.},

  title = {Target-oriented imaging using extended image volumes—a low-rank factorization approach},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Imaging in geological challenging environments has led to new developments, including the idea of generating reflection responses by means of interferometric redatuming at a given target datum in the subsurface, when the target datum lies beneath a complex overburden. One way to perform this redatuming is via conventional model-based wave-equation techniques. But those techniques can be computationally expensive for large-scale seismic
problems since the number of wave-equation solves is equal to two-times the number of
sources involved during seismic data acquisition. Also conventional shot-profile
techniques require lots of memory to save full subsurface extended image volumes. Therefore,
they only form subsurface image volumes in either horizontal or vertical directions. We now present a
randomized singular value decomposition based approach built upon the matrix
probing scheme, which takes advantage of the algebraic structure of the extended
imaging system. This low-rank representation enables us to overcome both the computational
cost associated with the number of wave-equation solutions and memory usage due to explicit
storage of full subsurface extended image volumes employed by conventional migration
methods. Experimental results on complex geological models demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed methodology and allow practical reflection-based extended imaging for large-scale 5D seismic data.},

  title = {Projection methods for nonlinear inverse problems with multiple constraints},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Nonlinear inverse problems are often hampered by non-uniqueness and local minima because of missing low frequencies and far offsets in the data, lack of access to good starting models, noise, and modeling errors. A well-known approach to counter these deficiencies is to include prior information on the unknown model, which regularizes the inverse problem. While conventional regularization methods have resulted in enormous progress in ill-posed (geophysical) inverse problems, challenges remain when the prior information consists of multiple pieces. To handle this situation, we propose an optimization framework that allows us to add multiple pieces of prior information in the form of constraints. Compared to additive regularization penalties, constraints have a number of advantages making them more suitable for inverse problems such as full-waveform inversion. The proposed framework is rigorous because it offers assurances that multiple constraints are imposed uniquely at each iteration, irrespective of the order in which they are invoked. To project onto the intersection of multiple sets uniquely, we employ Dykstra’s algorithm that scales to large problems and does not rely on trade-off parameters. In that sense, our approach differs substantially from approaches such as Tikhonov regularization, penalty methods, and gradient filtering. None of these offer assurances, which makes them less suitable to full-waveform inversion where unrealistic intermediate results effectively derail the iterative inversion process. By working with intersections of sets, we keep expensive objective and gradient calculations unaltered, separate from projections, and we also avoid trade-off parameters. These features allow for easy integration into existing code bases. In addition to more predictable behavior, working with constraints also allows for heuristics where we built up the complexity of the model gradually by relaxing the constraints. This strategy helps to avoid convergence to local minima that represent unrealistic models. We illustrate this unique feature with examples of varying complexity.},

  title = {Fast sparsity-promoting microseismic source inversion},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Microseismic events are generated during hydraulic fracturing of unconventional reservoirs and carry information on fracture locations and the origin times associated with these microseismic events. For drilling purposes and to prevent hazardous situations, we need to have accurate knowledge on the fracture locations as well as on their size, and their density. Because microseismic waves can travel far distances, microseismic data collected at the surface and or in boreholes can help us to monitor hydraulic fracturing. While so-called back propagation or time-reversal methods are able to focus recorded energy back onto the sources when a reasonable velocity model is available, these methods suffer from blurring especially in situations where the data acquisition suffers from lack of aperture, sparse sampling, and noise. As a result, these methods typically cannot resolve sources in close proximity, a desired feature since we need this information if we want to follow the fracture evolution in space and time. In that situation, we need to estimate the locations and the associated source-time functions for closely spaced microseismic sources along the active fractures. To overcome the limitations of time-reversal methods, we propose a wave-equation based inversion approach where we invert for the complete source wavefield in both space and time. By promoting sparsity on the source wavefield in space, we negate the effects of non-radiating sources during the inversion and obtain high-resolution intensity plots and high-fidelity estimates for the source-time functions. We obtain these results relatively fast by accelerating the linearized Bregman method with a dual formulation. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method is computationally feasible, robust to noise, and works for closely spaced sources with overlapping source-time functions in complex geological settings.},

  title = {Applications of low-rank compressed seismic data to full waveform inversion and extended image volumes},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = { Conventional oil and gas fields are increasingly difficult to explore and image, resulting in the call for more complex wave-equation based inversion algorithms that require dense long-offset samplings. Consequently, there is an exponential growth in the size of data volumes and prohibitive demands on computational resources. In this work, we propose a method to compress and process seismic data directly in a low-rank tensor format, which drastically reduces the amount of storage required to represent the data. We first outline how seismic data exhibits low-rank structure in a particular transform-domain, which can be exploited to compress the dense data in one extremely storage-efficient tensor format when the data is fully sampled. In the more realistic case of missing data, we can use efficient interpolation techniques to approximate the fully sampled volume in compressed form. In either case, once we have our data represented in its compressed tensor form, we design an algorithm to extract source or receiver gathers directly from the compressed parameters. This extraction process can be done on-the-fly directly on the compressed data, in a full waveform inversion context, and does not require scanning through the entire dataset in order to form shot gathers. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first major contributions to working with seismic data applications directly in the compressed domain without reconstructing the entire data volume. We use a stochastic inversion approach, which works with small subsets of source experiments at each iteration, further reducing the computational and memory costs of full waveform inversion. We also demonstrate how this data compression and extraction technique can be applied to forming full subsurface image gathers through probing techniques.},

  title = {A large-scale framework for symbolic implementations of seismic inversion algorithms in Julia},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Writing software packages for seismic inversion is a very challenging task, since problems such as full-waveform inversion or least-squares imaging are both algorithmically and computationally demanding due to the large number of unknown parameters and the fact that we are propagating waves over many wavelengths. Software frameworks therefore need to combine both versatility and performance to provide geophysicists with the means and flexibility to implement complex algorithms that scale to exceedingly large 3D problems. Following these principles, we introduce the Julia Devito Inversion framework, an open-source software package in Julia for large-scale seismic modeling and inversion based on Devito, a domain-specific language compiler for automatic code generation. The framework consists of matrix-free linear operators for implementing seismic inversion algorithms that closely resembles the mathematical notation, a flexible resilient parallelization and an interface to Devito for generating optimized stencil code to solve the underlying wave equations. In comparison to many manually optimized industry codes written in low-level languages, our software is built on the idea of independent layers of abstractions and user interfaces with symbolic operators, making it possible to manage both the complexity of algorithms and performance optimizations, while preserving modularity, which allows for a level of expressiveness needed to formulate a broad range of wave-equation-based inversion problems. Through a series of numerical examples, we demonstrate that this allows users to implement algorithms for waveform inversion and imaging as simple Julia scripts that scale to large-scale 3D problems; thus providing a truly performant research and production framework.},

  title = {Uncertainty quantification for inverse problems with weak
{PDE}-constraints},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = { In a statistical inverse problem, the objective is a complete
              statistical description of unknown parameters from noisy observations in order to quantify uncertainties of the parameters of interest. We consider inverse problems with partial-differential-equation-constraints, which are applicable to
              a variety of seismic problems. Bayesian inference is one of the most widely-used approaches to precisely quantify statistics through a posterior distribution, incorporating uncertainties in observed data, modeling kernel, and prior knowledge of the parameters. Typically when formulating the posterior distribution, the partial-differential-equation-constraints are required to be exactly satisfied, resulting in a highly nonlinear forward map and a posterior distribution with many local maxima. These drawbacks make it difficult to find an appropriate approximation for the posterior distribution. Another complicating factor is that traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are known to converge slowly for realistically sized problems. In this work, we relax the partial-differential-equation-constraints by introducing an auxiliary variable, which allows for Gaussian deviations in the partial-differential-equations. Thus, we obtain a new bilinear posterior distribution consisting of both data and partial-differential-equation misfit terms. We illustrate that for a particular range of variance choices for the partial-differential-equation misfit term, the new posterior distribution has fewer modes and can be well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution, which can then be sampled in a straightforward manner. Since it is prohibitively expensive to explicitly construct the dense covariance matrix of the Gaussian approximation for intermediate to large-scale problems, we present a method to implicitly construct it, which enables efficient sampling. We apply this framework to two-dimensional seismic inverse problems with 1,800 and 92,455 unknown parameters. The results illustrate that our framework can produce comparable statistical quantities to those produced by conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo type methods while requiring far fewer partial-differential-equation solves, which are the main computational bottlenecks in these problems.},

  title = {A unified {2D/3D} large scale software environment for nonlinear inverse problems},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Large scale parameter estimation problems are some of
                  the most computationally demanding problems. An

                  often precludes that of software design, which
                  results in software frameworks for inversion that
                  are technically correct, but not scalable to
                  realistically-sized problems. On the other hand, the
                  computational demands of the problem for realistic
                  problems result in industrial codebases that are
                  geared solely for performance, rather than
                  comprehensibility or flexibility. We propose a new
                  software design that bridges the gap between these
                  two seemingly disparate worlds. A hierarchical and

                  fully productive. We also introduce a new

  title = {Source estimation for wavefield-reconstruction inversion},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Source estimation is essential to all the wave-equation-based seismic inversions, including full-waveform inversion and the recently proposed wavefield-reconstruction inversion. When the source estimation is inaccurate, errors will propagate into the predicted data and introduce additional data misfit. As a consequence, inversion results that minimize this data misfit may become erroneous. To mitigate the errors introduced by the incorrect and pre-estimated sources, an embedded procedure that updates sources along with medium parameters is necessary for the inversion. So far, such a procedure is still missing in the context of wavefield-reconstruction inversion, a method that is, in many situations, less prone to local minima related to the so-called cycle skipping, compared to full-waveform inversion through exact data-fitting. While wavefield-reconstruction inversion indeed helps to mitigate issues related to cycle skipping by extending the search space with wavefields as auxiliary variables, it relies on having access to the correct source functions. In this paper, we remove the requirement of having the accurate source functions by proposing a source estimation technique specifically designed for wavefield-reconstruction inversion. To achieve this task, we consider the source functions as unknown variables and arrive at an objective function that depends on the medium parameters, wavefields, and source functions. During each iteration, we apply the so-called variable projection method to simultaneously project out the source functions and wavefields. After the projection, we obtain a reduced objective function that only depends on the medium parameters and invert for the unknown medium parameters by minimizing this reduced objective. Numerical experiments illustrate that this approach can produce accurate estimates of the unknown medium parameters without any prior information of the source functions.},
