  title = {Cheap time lapse with distributed Compressive Sensing---exploiting common information among the vintages},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Time-lapse seismic has been a powerful, but technically
                  challenging, practice for monitoring changes due to
                  production. Aside from physical changes amongst
                  time-lapse surveys---such as noise and variations in
                  water column velocities, over which we have limited
                  control---executing colocated densely sampled
                  baseline and monitor surveys with high degrees of
                  replicability are expensive propositions. We
                  demonstrate that under “ideal” circumstances, where
                  the surveys are in principle replicable,
                  high-quality pre-stack data can be obtained from
                  cheap randomized subsampled measurements that are
                  observed from nonreplicated surveys. Aside from the
                  obvious economic advantage of removing reliance on
                  replication during acquisition, we find that the
                  recovered densely sampled pre-stack baseline and
                  monitor data actually improve significantly when the
                  acquisitions are not replicated. We achieve this
                  result by using the fact that different time-lapse
                  data share information and that nonreplicated
                  surveys can add information when pre-stack data are
                  recovered jointly. Whenever the time-lapse data
                  exhibit joint structure---i.e., are compressible in
                  some transform domain and share
                  information---sparsity-promoting recovery of the
                  “common component” and “innovations”, with respect
                  to this common component, outperforms independent
                  recovery of both the pre-stack baseline and monitor
                  data. The recovered time-lapse data are of high
                  enough quality to serve as input to extract
                  post-stack attributes used to compute time-lapse
                  differences. Without joint recovery, artifacts---due
                  to the randomized subsampling---lead to
                  deterioration of the degree of repeatability of the
                  time-lapse data. We support our claims by carrying
                  out experiments that collect reliable statistics
                  from thousands of repeated experiments. We also
                  confirm that high degrees of repeatability are
                  achievable for an ocean-bottom cable survey acquired
                  with time-jittered continuous recording.},

  title = {Cheap time lapse with distributed {Compressive Sensing}---impact on repeatability},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Irregular or off-the-grid spatial sampling of sources
                  and receivers is inevitable in field seismic
                  acquisitions. Consequently, time-lapse surveys
                  become particularly expensive since current
                  practices aim to replicate densely sampled surveys
                  for monitoring changes occurring in the reservoir
                  due to hydrocarbon production. We demonstrate that
                  under certain circumstances, high-quality prestack
                  data can be obtained from cheap randomized
                  subsampled measurements that are observed from
                  nonreplicated surveys. We extend our time-jittered
                  marine acquisition to time-lapse surveys by
                  designing acquisition on irregular spatial grids
                  that render simultaneous, subsampled and irregular
                  measurements. Using the fact that different
                  time-lapse data share information and that
                  nonreplicated surveys add information when prestack
                  data are recovered jointly, we recover periodic
                  densely sampled and colocated prestack data by
                  adapting the recovery method to incorporate a
                  regularization operator that maps traces from an
                  irregular spatial grid to a regular periodic
                  grid. The recovery method is, therefore, a combined
                  operation of regularization, interpolation
                  (estimating missing fine-grid traces from subsampled
                  coarse-grid data), and source separation (unraveling
                  overlapping shot records). By relaxing the
                  insistence on replicability between surveys, we find
                  that recovery of the time-lapse difference shows
                  little variability for realistic field scenarios of
                  slightly nonreplicated surveys that suffer from
                  unavoidable natural deviations in spatial sampling
                  of shots (or receivers) and pragmatic
                  compressed-sensing based nonreplicated surveys when
                  compared to the "ideal" scenario of exact
                  replicability between surveys. Moreover, the
                  recovered densely sampled prestack baseline and
                  monitor data improve significantly when the
                  acquisitions are not replicated, and hence can serve
                  as input to extract poststack attributes used to
                  compute time-lapse differences. Our observations are
                  based on numerous experiments conducted for an
                  ocean-bottom cable survey acquired with
                  time-jittered continuous recording assuming source
                  equalization (or same source signature) for the
                  time-lapse surveys and no changes in wave heights,
                  water column velocities or temperature and salinity
                  profiles, etc.},

  title = {Enabling affordable omnidirectional subsurface extended image volumes via probing},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {Image gathers as a function of subsurface offset are an
                  important tool for the inference of rock properties
                  and velocity analysis in areas of complex
                  geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of
                  as multidimensional correlations of the source and
                  receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing
                  these gathers lies in the fact that one needs to
                  store, compute, and correlate these wavefields for
                  all shots in order to obtain the desired image
                  gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically
                  only computed for a limited number of subsurface
                  points and for a limited range of subsurface
                  offsets, which may cause problems in complex
                  geological areas with large geologic dips. We
                  overcome increasing computational and storage costs
                  of extended image volumes by introducing a
                  formulation that avoids explicit storage and removes
                  the customary and expensive loop over shots, found
                  in conventional extended imaging. As a result, we
                  end up with a matrix-vector formulation from which
                  different image gathers can be formed and with which
                  amplitude-versus-angle and wave-equation migration
                  velocity analyses can be performed without requiring
                  prior information on the geologic dips. Aside from
                  demonstrating the formation of two-way extended
                  image gathers for different purposes and at greatly
                  reduced costs, we also present a new approach to
                  conduct automatic wave-equation based
                  migration-velocity analysis. Instead of focussing in
                  particular offset directions and preselected subsets
                  of subsurface points, our method focuses every
                  subsurface point for all subsurface offset
                  directions using a randomized probing technique. As
                  a consequence, we obtain good velocity models at low
                  cost for complex models without the need to provide
                  information on the geologic dips.},
