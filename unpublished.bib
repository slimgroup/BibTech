        signal reconstruction from compressed sensing measurements when partial
        support information is available. We show that if at least 50\% of
        the (partial) support information is accurate, then weighted $\ell_1$
        minimization is stable and robust under weaker sufficient conditions
        than the analogous conditions for standard $\ell_1$ minimization.
        Moreover, weighted $\ell_1$ minimization provides better upper bounds
        on the reconstruction error in terms of the measurement noise and
        the compressibility of the signal to be recovered. We illustrate
        our results with extensive numerical experiments on synthetic data

abstract={ Images obtained from seismic data are used by the oil and gas industry for geophysical exploration. Cutting-edge methods for transforming the data into interpretable images are moving away from linear approximations and high-frequency asymptotics towards Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), a nonlinear data-fitting procedure based on full data modeling using the wave-equation. The size of the problem, the nonlinearity of the for- ward model, and ill-posedness of the formulation all contribute to a pressing need for fast algorithms and novel regularization techniques to speed up and improve inversion results. In this paper, we design a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm to solve the PDE- constrained optimization problem using ideas from stochastic optimization and com- pressive sensing. More specifically, we replace the Gauss-Newton subproblems by ran- domly subsampled, -$\ell_1$ regularized subproblems. This allows us us significantly reduce the computational cost of calculating the updates and exploit the compressibility of wavefields in Curvelets. We explain the relationships and connections between the new method and stochastic optimization and compressive sensing (CS), and demonstrate the efficacy of the new method on a large-scale synthetic seismic example. }

  abstract = {Seismic data acquisition in marine environments is a costly process
        that compels the adoption of simultaneous-source acquisition - an
        emerging technology that is stimu- lating both geophysical research
        and commercial efforts. In this paper, we discuss the properties
        of randomized simultaneous acquisition matrices and demonstrate that
        sparsity-promoting recovery improves the quality of the reconstructed
        seismic data volumes. Leveraging established findings from the field
        of compressive sensing, we demonstrate that the choice of the sparsifying
        transform that is incoherent with the compressive sampling matrix
        can significantly impact the reconstruction quality. Si- multaneous
        marine acquisition calls for the development of a new set of design
        principles and post-processing tools. We propose to use random time
        dithering where sequential acquisition with a single airgun is replaced
        by continuous acquisition with multiple airguns firing at random
        times and at random locations. We then demonstrate that the resulting
        compressive sampling matrix is incoherent with the curvelet transform
        and the combined measurement matrix exhibits better isometry properties
        than other transform bases such as a non-localized multidimensional
        Fourier transform. We il- lustrate our results with simulations of
        simultaneous-source marine acquisition using periodic and randomized
        time dithering.},

  title = {Fast waveform inversion without source encoding.},
  year = {2011},
  type = {Tech. Rep.},
  address = {University of British Columbia, Vancouver},
  month = {September},
  abstract = {Randomized source encoding has recently been proposed as a way to
        dramatically reduce the costs of full waveform inversion. The main
        idea is to replace all sequential sources by a small number of simultaneous
        sources. This introduces random crosstalk in the model updates and
        special stochastic optimization strategies are required to deal with
        this. Two problems arise with this approach: i) source encoding can
        only be applied to fixed-spread acquisition setups, and ii) stochastic
        optimization methods tend to converge very slowly, relying on averaging
        to get rid of the cross-talk. Although the slow convergence is partly
        offset by the low iteration cost, we show that conventional optimization
        strategies are bound to outperform stochastic methods in the long
        run. In this paper we argue that we donÂ¿t need randomized source
        encoding to reap the benefits of stochastic optimization and we review
        an optimization strategy that combines the benefits of both conventional
        and stochastic optimization. The method uses a gradually increasing
        batch of sources. Thus, iterations are very cheap initially and this
        allows the method to make fast progress in the beginning. As the
        batch size grows, the method behaves like conventional optimization,
        allowing for fast convergence. Numerical examples suggest that the
        stochastic and hybrid method perform equally well with and without
        source encoding and that the hybrid method outperforms both conventional
        and stochastic optimization. The method does not rely on source encoding
        techniques and can thus be applied to non fixed-spread data.},

  month = {September},
  abstract = { Wave-equation based seismic inversion can be formulated as a nonlinear
        inverse problem where the medium properties are obtained via minimization
        of a least- squares misfit functional. The demand for higher resolution
        models in more geologically complex areas drives the need to develop
        techniques that explore the special structure of full-waveform inversion
        to reduce the computational burden and to regularize the inverse
        problem. We meet these goals by using ideas from compressive sensing
        and stochastic optimization to design a novel Gauss-Newton method,
        where the updates are computed from random subsets of the data via
        curvelet-domain sparsity promotion. Application of this idea to a
        realistic synthetic shows improved results compared to quasi-Newton
        methods, which require passes through all data. Two different subset
        sampling strategies are considered: randomized source encoding, and
        drawing sequential shots firing at random source locations from marine
        data with missing near and far offsets. In both cases, we obtain
        excellent inversion results compared to conventional methods at reduced

  abstract = {We consider a class of inverse problems in which the forward model
        is the solution operator to linear ODEs or PDEs. This class admits
        several dimensionality-reduction techniques based on data averaging
        or sampling, which are especially useful for large-scale problems.
        We survey these approaches and their connection to stochastic optimization.
        The data-averaging approach is only viable, however, for a least-squares
        misfit, which is sensitive to outliers in the data and artifacts
        unexplained by the forward model. This motivates us to propose a
        robust formulation based on the Student's t-distribution of the error.
        We demonstrate how the corresponding penalty function, together with
        the sampling approach, can obtain good results for a large-scale
        seismic inverse problem with 50% corrupted data.},

Title={ Robust inversion via semistochastic dimensionality reduction},
Year={2011},
Abstract={In this paper, we offer an alternative sampling method leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing towards seismic acquisition and processing for data that are traditionally considered to be undersampled. The main outcome of this approach is a new technology where acquisition and processing related costs are no longer determined by overly stringent sampling criteria, such as Nyquist. At the heart of our approach lies randomized incoherent sampling that breaks subsampling related interferences by turning them into harmless noise, which we subsequently remove by promoting transform-domain sparsity. Now, costs no longer grow with resolution and dimensionality of the survey area, but instead depend on transform-domain sparsity only. Our contribution is twofold. First, we demonstrate by means of carefully designed numerical experiments that compressive sensing can successfully be adapted to seismic acquisition. Second, we show that accurate recovery can be accomplished for compressively sampled data volumes sizes that exceed the size of conventional transform-domain data volumes by only a small factor. Because compressive sensing combines transformation and encoding by a single linear encoding step, this technology is directly applicable to acquisition and to dimensionality reduction during processing. In either case, sampling, storage, and processing costs scale with transform-domain sparsity. We illustrate this principle by means of number of case studies. },

Abstract = {Seismic imaging can be formulated as a linear inverse problem where a medium perturbation is obtained via minimization of a least-squares misfit functional. The demand for higher resolution images in more geophysically complex areas drives the need to develop techniques that handle problems of tremendous size with limited computational resources. While seismic imaging is amenable to dimensionality reduction techniques that collapse the data volume into a smaller set of âsuper-shotsâ, these techniques break down for complex acquisition geometries such as marine acquisition, where sources and receivers move during acquisition. To meet these challenges, we propose a novel method that combines sparsity-promoting (SP) solvers with random sub- set selection of sequential shots, yielding a SP algorithm that only ever sees a small portion of the full data, enabling its application to very large-scale problems. Application of this technique yields excellent results for a complicated synthetic, which underscores the robustness of sparsity promotion and its suitability for seismic imaging.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a support driven reweighted $\ell$_ï¿¿1 minimization algorithm (SDRL1) that solves a sequence of weighted $\ell$_ï¿¿1 problems and relies on the support estimate accu- racy. Our SDRL1 algorithm is related to the IRL1 algorithm proposed by Cande`s, Wakin, and Boyd. We demonstrate that it is sufficient to find support estimates with good accuracy and apply constant weights instead of using the inverse coefficient magnitudes to achieve gains similar to those of IRL1. We then prove that given a support estimate with sufficient accuracy, if the signal decays according to a specific rate, the solution to the weighted ï¿¿1 minimization problem results in a support estimate with higher accuracy than the initial estimate. We also show that under certain conditions, it is possible to achieve higher estimate accuracy when the inter- section of support estimates is considered. We demonstrate the performance of SDRL1 through numerical simulations and compare it with that of IRL1 and standard ï¿¿$\ell$_ï¿¿1 minimization.},
