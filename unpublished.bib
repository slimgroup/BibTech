  title = {A unified {2D/3D} large scale software environment for nonlinear inverse problems},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Large scale parameter estimation problems are some of
                  the most computationally demanding problems. An
                  academic researcher's domain-specific knowledge
                  often precludes that of software design, which
                  results in software frameworks for inversion that
                  are technically correct, but not scalable to
                  realistically-sized problems. On the other hand, the
                  computational demands of the problem for realistic
                  problems result in industrial codebases that are
                  geared solely for performance, rather than
                  comprehensibility or flexibility. We propose a new
                  software design that bridges the gap between these
                  two seemingly disparate worlds. A hierarchical and
                  modular design allows a user to delve into as much
                  detail as she desires, while using high performance
                  primitives at the lower levels. Our code has the
                  added benefit of actually reflecting the underlying
                  mathematics of the problem, which lowers the
                  cognitive load on user using it and reduces the
                  initial startup period before a researcher can be
                  fully productive. We also introduce a new
                  preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation that is
                  suitable for fault-tolerant distributed
                  systems. Numerical experiments on a variety of 2D
                  and 3D test problems demonstrate the effectiveness
                  of this approach on scaling algorithms from small to
                  large scale problems with minimal code changes.},

  title = {Source estimation for wavefield-reconstruction inversion},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Source estimation is essential to all the wave-equation-based seismic inversions, including full-waveform inversion and the recently proposed wavefield-reconstruction inversion. When the source estimation is inaccurate, errors will propagate into the predicted data and introduce additional data misfit. As a consequence, inversion results that minimize this data misfit may become erroneous. To mitigate the errors introduced by the incorrect and pre-estimated sources, an embedded procedure that updates sources along with medium parameters is necessary for the inversion. So far, such a procedure is still missing in the context of wavefield-reconstruction inversion, a method that is, in many situations, less prone to local minima related to the so-called cycle skipping, compared to full-waveform inversion through exact data-fitting. While wavefield-reconstruction inversion indeed helps to mitigate issues related to cycle skipping by extending the search space with wavefields as auxiliary variables, it relies on having access to the correct source functions. In this paper, we remove the requirement of having the accurate source functions by proposing a source estimation technique specifically designed for wavefield-reconstruction inversion. To achieve this task, we consider the source functions as unknown variables and arrive at an objective function that depends on the medium parameters, wavefields, and source functions. During each iteration, we apply the so-called variable projection method to simultaneously project out the source functions and wavefields. After the projection, we obtain a reduced objective function that only depends on the medium parameters and invert for the unknown medium parameters by minimizing this reduced objective. Numerical experiments illustrate that this approach can produce accurate estimates of the unknown medium parameters without any prior information of the source functions.},

  title = {Full-Waveform Inversion - Part 2: adjoint modeling},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {This tutorial is the second part of a three part tutorial series on full-waveform inversion (FWI), in which we provide a step by step walk through of setting up forward and adjoint wave equation solvers and an optimization framework for inversion. In part 1 (Louboutin et al., 2017), we demonstrated how to discretize the acoustic wave equation and how to set up a basic forward modeling scheme using Devito, a domain-specific language (DSL) in Python for automated finite-difference (FD) computations (Lange et al., 2016). Devito allows us to define wave equations as symbolic Python expressions (Meurer et al., 2017), from which optimized FD stencil code is automatically generated at run time. In part 1, we show how we can use Devito to set up and solve acoustic wave equations with (impulsive) seismic sources and sample wavefields at the receiver locations to model shot records.},
