  abstract = {This thesis will address the large computational costs
                  of solving least-squares migration and full-waveform
                  inversion problems. Least-squares seismic imaging
                  and full-waveform inversion are seismic inversion
                  techniques that require iterative minimizations of
                  large least-squares misfit functions. Each iteration
                  requires an evaluation of the Jacobian operator and
                  its adjoint, both of which require two wave-equation
                  solves for all sources, creating prohibitive
                  computational costs. In order to reduce costs, we
                  utilize randomized dimensionality reduction
                  techniques, reducing the number of sources used
                  during inversion. The randomized dimensionality
                  reduction techniques create subsampling related
                  artifacts, which we mitigate by using
                  curvelet-domain sparsity-promoting inversion
                  techniques. Our method conducts least-squares
                  imaging at the approximate cost of one reverse-time
                  migration with all sources, and computes the
                  Gauss-Newton full-waveform inversion update at
                  roughly the cost of one gradient update with all
                  sources. Finally, during our research of the
                  full-waveform inversion problem, we discovered that
                  we can utilize our method as an alternative approach
                  to add sparse constraints on the entire velocity
                  model by imposing sparsity constraints on each model
                  update separately, rather than regularizing the
                  total velocity model as typically practiced. We also
                  observed this alternative approach yields a faster
                  decay of the residual and model error as a function
                  of iterations. We provided empirical arguments why
                  and when imposing sparsity on the updates can lead
                  to improved full-waveform inversion results.},

  title = {Curvelet-based migration amplitude recovery},
  school = {The University of British Columbia},
  year = {2010},

  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {Migration can accurately locate reflectors in the earth
                  but in most cases fails to correctly resolve their
                  amplitude. This might lead to mis-interpretation of
                  the nature of reflector. In this thesis, I
                  introduced a method to accurately recover the
                  amplitude of the seismic reflector. This method
                  relies on a new transform-based recovery that
                  exploits the expression of seismic images by the
                  recently developed curvelet transform. The elements
                  of this transform, called curvelets, are
                  multi-dimensional, multi-scale, and
                  multi-directional. They also remain approximately
                  invariant under the imaging operator. I exploit
                  these properties of the curvelets to introduce a
                  method called Curvelet Match Filtering (CMF) for
                  recovering the seismic amplitude in presence of
                  noise in both migrated image and data. I detail the
                  method and illustrate its performance on synthetic
                  dataset. I also extend CMF formulation to other
                  geophysical applications and present results on
                  multiple removal. In addition of that, I investigate
                  preconditioning of the migration which results to
                  rapid convergence rate of the iterative method using
                  migration.},

  title = {Sampling and reconstruction of seismic wavefields in the curvelet domain},
  school = {The University of British Columbia},
  year = {2008},
  month = {05},
  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {Wavefield reconstruction is a crucial step in the
                  seismic processing flow. For instance, unsuccessful
                  interpolation leads to erroneous multiple
                  predictions that adversely affect the performance of
                  multiple elimination, and to imaging artifacts. We
                  present a new non-parametric transform-based
                  reconstruction method that exploits the compression
                  of seismic data by the recently developed curvelet
                  transform. The elements of this transform, called
                  curvelets, are multi-dimensional, multi-scale, and
                  multi-directional. They locally resemble wavefronts
                  present in the data, which leads to a compressible
                  representation for seismic data. This compression
                  enables us to formulate a new curvelet-based seismic
                  data recovery algorithm through sparsity-promoting
                  inversion (CRSI). The concept of sparsity-promoting
                  inversion is in itself not new to
                  geophysics. However, the recent insights from the
                  field of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}compressed
                  sensing{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} are new
                  since they clearly identify the three main
                  ingredients that go into a successful formulation of
                  a reconstruction problem, namely a sparsifying
                  transform, a sub-Nyquist sampling strategy that
                  subdues coherent aliases in the sparsifying domain,
                  and a data-consistent sparsity-promoting
                  program. After a brief overview of the curvelet
                  transform and our seismic-oriented extension to the
                  fast discrete curvelet transform, we detail the CRSI
                  formulation and illustrate its performance on
                  synthetic and real datasets. Then, we introduce a
                  sub-Nyquist sampling scheme, termed jittered
                  undersampling, and show that, for the same amount of
                  data acquired, jittered data are best interpolated
                  using CRSI compared to regular or random
                  undersampled data. We also discuss the large-scale
                  one-norm solver involved in CRSI. Finally, we extend
                  CRSI formulation to other geophysical applications
                  and present results on multiple removal and
                  migration-amplitude recovery.},
