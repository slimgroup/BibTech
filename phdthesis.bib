  abstract = {Migration can accurately locate reflectors in the earth but in most
	cases fails to correctly resolve their amplitude. This might lead
	to mis-interpretation of the nature of reflector. In this thesis,
	I introduced a method to accurately recover the amplitude of the
	seismic reflector. This method relies on a new transform-based recovery
	that exploits the expression of seismic images by the recently developed
	curvelet transform. The elements of this transform, called curvelets,
	are multi-dimensional, multi-scale, and multi-directional. They also
	remain approximately invariant under the imaging operator. I exploit
	these properties of the curvelets to introduce a method called Curvelet
	Match Filtering (CMF) for recovering the seismic amplitude in presence
	of noise in both migrated image and data. I detail the method and
	illustrate its performance on synthetic dataset. I also extend CMF
	formulation to other geophysical applications and present results
	on multiple removal. In addition of that, I investigate preconditioning
	of the migration which results to rapid convergence rate of the iterative
	method using migration.},

  title = {Sampling and reconstruction of seismic wavefields in the curvelet
	domain},

  year = {2008},
  type = {phd},
  address = {Vancouver, BC Canada},
  month = {May},
  abstract = {Wavefield reconstruction is a crucial step in the seismic processing
	flow. For instance, unsuccessful interpolation leads to erroneous
	multiple predictions that adversely affect the performance of multiple
	elimination, and to imaging artifacts. We present a new non-parametric
	transform-based reconstruction method that exploits the compression
	of seismic data by the recently developed curvelet transform. The
	elements of this transform, called curvelets, are multi-dimensional,
	multi-scale, and multi-directional. They locally resemble wavefronts
	present in the data, which leads to a compressible representation
	for seismic data. This compression enables us to formulate a new
	curvelet-based seismic data recovery algorithm through sparsity-promoting
	inversion (CRSI). The concept of sparsity-promoting inversion is
	in itself not new to geophysics. However, the recent insights from
	the field of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}compressed sensing{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}
	are new since they clearly identify the three main ingredients that
	go into a successful formulation of a reconstruction problem, namely
	a sparsifying transform, a sub-Nyquist sampling strategy that subdues
	coherent aliases in the sparsifying domain, and a data-consistent
	sparsity-promoting program. After a brief overview of the curvelet
	transform and our seismic-oriented extension to the fast discrete
	curvelet transform, we detail the CRSI formulation and illustrate
	its performance on synthetic and real datasets. Then, we introduce
	a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme, termed jittered undersampling, and
	show that, for the same amount of data acquired, jittered data are
	best interpolated using CRSI compared to regular or random undersampled
	data. We also discuss the large-scale one-norm solver involved in
	CRSI. Finally, we extend CRSI formulation to other geophysical applications
	and present results on multiple removal and migration-amplitude recovery.},
