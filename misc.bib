  booktitle = {GT SEG Student Chapter},  
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification is essential when dealing with
ill-conditioned inverse problems due to the inherent nonuniqueness of the
solution. Bayesian approaches allow us to determine how likely an estimation
of the unknown parameters is via formulating the posterior distribution.
Unfortunately, it is often not possible to formulate a prior distribution
that precisely encodes our prior knowledge about the unknown. Furthermore,
adherence to handcrafted priors may greatly bias the outcome of the Bayesian
analysis. To address this issue, we propose to use the functional form of a
randomly initialized convolutional neural network as an implicit structured
prior, which is shown to promote natural images and excludes images with
unnatural noise. In order to incorporate the model uncertainty into the final
estimate, we sample the posterior distribution using stochastic gradient
Langevin dynamics and perform Bayesian model averaging on the obtained
samples. Our synthetic numerical experiment verifies that deep priors
combined with Bayesian model averaging are able to partially circumvent
imaging artifacts and reduce the risk of overfitting in the presence of
extreme noise. Finally, we present pointwise variance of the estimates as a
measure of uncertainty, which coincides with regions that are more difficult
to image.},

  abstract = {During these times of sustained low oil prices, it is essential to look for new innovative ways to collect (time-lapse) seismic data at reduced costs and preferably also at reduced environmental impact. By now, there is an increasing body of corroborating evidence — whether these are simulated case studies or actual acquisitions on land and marine — that seismic acquisition based on the principles of compressive sensing delivers on this premise by removing the need to acquire replicated dense surveys. Up to ten-fold increases in acquisition efficiency have been reported by industry while there are indications that this breakthrough is only the beginning of a paradigm shift where full-azimuth time-lapse processing will become a reality. To familiarize the audience with this new technology, I will first describe the basics of compressive sensing, how it relates to missing-trace interpolation and simultaneous source acquisition, followed by how this technology is driving innovations in full-azimuth (time-lapse) acquisition, yielding high-fidelity data with a high degree of repeatability and at a fraction of the costs.},
