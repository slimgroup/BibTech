TITLE = {Seismic denoising with non-uniformly sampled curvelets},
JOURNAL = {Computing in Science and Engineering},
YEAR = 2006,
NOTE = {(Invited paper)}
\abstract{In this paper, we present an extension of the Fast Discrete Curvelet
  Transform (FDCT) to non-uniformly sampled data, NFDCT. With this
  extension to non-uniform grids, we are able to not only restore
  curvelet compression rates for non-uniformly sampled data but also
  remove noise and map the data to a regular grid.}

TITLE = {Sparsity- and continuity-promoting seismic image recovery with
  curvelet frames},
JOURNAL = {abcd},
YEAR = 2006,
\abstract{A nonlinear singularity-preserving solution to seismic image
  recovery with sparseness and continuity constraints is proposed. The
  method explicitly explores the curvelet transform as a directional
  frame expansion that, by virtue of its sparsity on seismic images
  and its invariance under the Hessian of the linearized imaging
  problem, allows for a stable recovery of the migration amplitudes
  from noisy data. The method corresponds to a preconditioning that
  corrects the amplitudes during a post-processing step.  The solution
  is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem where sparsity in
  the curvelet domain as well as continuity along the imaged
  reflectors are jointly promoted. To enhance sparsity, the
  $\ell_1$-norm on the curvelet coefficients is minimized while
  continuity is promoted by minimizing an anisotropic diffusion norm
  on the image. The performance of the recovery scheme is evaluated
  with a post-stack 'wave-equation' migration code on a synthetic
  dataset.}

@ARTICLE{FelixPrimaMult,
AUTHOR = {F. J. Herrmann and Urs Boeniger and Dirk-Jacob (Eric) Verschuur},
TITLE = {Nonlinear primary-multiple separation with directional
  curvelet frames},
JOURNAL = {In preparation},
YEAR = 2006,
\abstract{Predictive multiple suppression methods consist of two main steps: a
  prediction step, during which multiples are predicted from seismic
  data, and a primary-multiple separation step, during which the
  predicted multiples are matched with the true multiples in the data.
  The last step is crucial in practice: an incorrect separation, by
  adaptive subtraction for instance, will cause residual multiple
  energy in the result or may lead to a distortion
  in the primaries, or both. To reduce these adverse effects, a new
  transform domain is proposed where primaries and multiples are
  separated rather than matched. The separation is carried out on the
  basis of differences in the multiscale and multidirectional
  characteristics of these two signal components. Our method is based
  on the curvelet transform that maps the data into almost orthogonal
  localized prototype waveforms with varying directional and
  spatial-temporal content. The data is separated into its primaries-only
  and multiples-only components by an iterative thresholding
  scheme which is stable under noisy input data. The separation is
  formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes the data misfit
  and imposes sparseness (weighted $\ell^1$-norm) on both signal
  components in the transformed domain.  Whenever the prediction for
  the two signal components correlate the signal is suppressed while
  for regions where the correlation is small the method seeks the
  sparsest set of coefficients that represent either signal component.
  As such our method differs from traditional matched filtering
  techniques. The Bayesian interpretation of our method is that the
  $\log$-likelyhood function is minimized while the two signal
  components are assumed to be given by a superposition of prototype
  waveforms drawn independently from a probability function weighted
  by predictions for the primaries and multiples. Synthetic and field
  data examples based on multiple prediction by the data-driven
  surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) method show a considerable
  improvement in multiple suppression compared to the tradictional
  adaptive matching, which translates in an improved interpretation of the primaries.}

@ARTICLE{TimeLapse,
AUTHOR = {M. Beyreuther and J. Cristall and F. J.  Herrmann},
TITLE = {Computation of time-lapse differences with 3D directional frames},
JOURNAL = {abcd},
YEAR = 2006,
\abstract{We present an alternative method of extracting production related
differences from time-lapse seismic data sets. Our method is not
based on the actual subtraction of the two data sets, risking the
enhancement of noise and introduction of artifacts due to local
phase rotation
and slightly misaligned events.  Rather, it mutes events of the
monitor survey with respect to the baseline survey based on the
magnitudes of coefficients in a sparse and local atomic
decomposition. Our technique is demonstrated to be an effective
tool for enhancing the time-lapse signal from surveys which have
been cross-equalized.}
