                  outperform the Gaussian matrices when we are in a

  year = {2013},
  abstract = {The interferometric formulation of linear wave-based
                  inversion problem was proposed by Demanet and Jugnon
                  recently. Instead of directly fitting the data, they
                  proposed to fit a subset of the data's
                  cross-correlation. It can be verified that if the
                  full cross-correlation is used, then the problem is
                  equivalent to the usual least square problem. The
                  subsampling, which is usually considered to cause
                  instability to the solution, is surprisingly useful
                  in this setting. Numerical experiments for the
                  inverse source problem and the inverse scatting
                  problem have both suggested that a 'good' sampling
                  strategy can actually increase the stability under
                  modeling error caused by the uncertainty of a
                  kinetic nature. We will study the mathematical
                  mechanism behind this phenomenon, and try to see
                  whether or not there exists a universally 'good'
                  sampling strategy independent of the types of
                  forward operators we use.},

                  -optimization require our forward operator to be
                  orthogonal, though we use redundant transforms in
                  practice. These traditional arguments do not
                  translate to redundant transforms, and other
                  arguments require impractical conditions on our
                  effective measurement matrix. Recent theory in
                  one-norm analysis, namely the optimal dual $\ell_1$
                  analysis of Shidong et al, have provided point-wise
                  reconstruction error estimates for synthesis using
                  an equivalence relationship where we can use weaker
                  assumptions. This exposes an important model
                  assumption indicating why analysis might outperform
                  synthesis, for which careful consideration in
                  seismic is necessary, and the need for models such
                  as the cosparse model. In this talk we will discuss
                  these ideas, provide evidence which indicates this
                  theory should generalize to uniform error
                  estimates(and thus not signal dependent), and how

                  is a composition of a convex function, whose
                  proximal mapping is easy to compute, and a nonzero

                  seismic data volumes remains a computationally
                  daunting task. In this work, we outline a
                  comprehensive framework for sampling and
                  interpolating such volumes based on the
                  well-understood theory of Matrix and Tensor
                  completion. This interpolation theory consists of
                  three components major signal structure,
                  structure-destroying sampling, and
                  structure-restoring optimization. By viewing
                  interpolation in the context of this theory, we are
                  able to specify exactly when these approaches are

                  higher-resolution images have led to the deployment
                  of multiple source vessels across the survey area. A
                  step ahead from multi-source seismic acquisition is
                  simultaneous or blended acquisition where different
                  source arrays/vessels fire shots at
                  near-simultaneous or slightly random times. Seismic
                  data acquisition with simultaneous (or blended)
                  sources has helped improve acquisition efficiency
                  and mitigate acquisition related costs. Deblending

                  during conventional acquisition, from blended data
                  since many processing techniques rely on full,

                  expensive to compute these CIG for all the

                  efficient way to compute CIG for all subsurface
                  offsets without explicitly calculating the source
                  and receiver wavefields for all the sources. Because
                  the CIG contain all possible subsurface offsets, we
                  compute the angle-domain image gathers by selecting
                  the subsurface offset that is aligned with the local
                  geologic dip. We propose a method to compute the
                  local dip information directly from

                  high, which may lead to over fitting the

                  address this issue. Most commonly, people data-
                  filtering operations that are aimed to deemphasize

                  addresses both the need to efficiently solve the
                  Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost
                  induced by the many right-hand sides. To solve the
                  Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic
                  preconditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is
                  well-suited for inversion because of its
                  robustness. We extend this method to a
                  block-iterative method that can efficiently handle
                  multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the
                  computational cost of of the overall optimization
                  procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from
                  stochastic optimization that allow us to work with
                  approximate gradient information. These
                  approximations are obtained by evaluating only a
                  small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by
                  solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics

                  problems that occur in (geophysical) inversion
                  problems. The method takes measured data from a
                  physical system as input and minimizes an objective
                  function that depends on an unknown model for the
                  physical parameters, fields, and additional nuisance
                  parameters such as the source function. The
                  invention consists of a minimization procedure
                  involving a cost functional comprising of a
                  data-misfit term and a penalty term that measures
                  how accurately the fields satisfy the PDE. The
                  method is composed of two alternating steps, namely
                  the solution of a system of equations forming the
                  discretization of the data-augmented PDE, and the
                  solution of physical model parameters from the PDE
                  itself given the field that solves the
                  data-augmented system and an estimate for the
                  sources. Compared to all-at-once approaches to
                  PDE-constrained optimization, there is no need to
                  update and store the fields for all sources leading
                  to significant memory savings. As in the all-at-once
                  approach, the proposed method explores a larger
                  search space and is therefore less sensitive to
                  initial estimates for the physical model
                  parameters. Contrary to the reduced formulation, the
                  proposed method does not require the solution of an
                  adjoint PDE, effectively halving the number of PDE
                  solves and memory requirement. As in the reduced
                  formulation, fields can be computed independently
                  and aggregated, possibly in parallel.},

                  high-dimensional tensors exhibiting particular
                  low-rank structure. With some minor alterations to
                  existing theoretical developments, we develop an
                  optimization framework based on the geometric
                  understanding of HT tensors as a smooth manifold, a
                  generalization of smooth curves/surfaces. Building
                  on the existing research of solving optimization
                  problems on smooth manifolds, we develop Steepest
                  Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods for HT
                  tensors. The resulting algorithms converge quickly,
                  are immediately parallelizable, and do not require
                  the computation of SVDs. We also derive efficient
                  Gauss-Newton based algorithms which converge much
                  faster than standard, first-order methods. We also
                  extend ideas about favourable sampling conditions
                  for missing-data recovery from the field of Matrix
                  Completion to Tensor Completion and demonstrate how
                  the organization of data can affect the success of
                  recovery. As a result, if one has data with randomly
                  missing source pairs, using these ideas, coupled
                  with an efficient solver, one can interpolate
                  large-scale seismic data volumes with missing
                  sources and/or receivers by exploiting the
                  multidimensional dependencies in the data. We are
                  able to recover data volumes amidst extremely high
                  subsampling ratios (in some cases, > 75%) using this

  abstract = {Wave-equation based inversions, such as full-waveform
                  inversion, are challenging because of their
                  computational costs, memory requirements, and
                  reliance on accurate initial models. To confront
                  these issues, we propose a novel formulation of
                  full-waveform inversion based on a penalty
                  method. In this formulation, the objective function
                  consists of a data-misfit term and a penalty term
                  which measures how accurately the wavefields satisfy
                  the wave-equation. Because we carry out the
                  inversion over a larger search space, including both
                  the model and synthetic wavefields, our approach
                  suffers less from local minima. Our main
                  contribution is the development of an efficient
                  optimization scheme that avoids having to store and
                  update the wavefields by explicit
                  elimination. Compared to existing optimization
                  strategies for full-waveform inversion, our method
                  differers in two main aspects; i. The wavefields are
                  solved from an augmented wave-equation, where the
                  solution is forced to solve the wave-equation and
                  fit the observed data, ii. no adjoint wavefields are
                  required to update the model, which leads to
                  significant computational savings. We demonstrate
                  the validity of our approach by carefully selected
                  examples and discuss possible extensions and future

                  geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of
                  as multidimensional correlations of the source and
                  receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing the
                  gathers lies in the fact that one needs to store and
                  compute these wavefields and in correlating the
                  wavefields to obtain the desired image
                  gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically
                  only computed for a limited number of subsurface
                  points and for a limited range of subsurface
                  offsets. In this presentation, we offer a new
                  perspective on such gathers by organizing the
                  extended image as a function of all subsurface
                  offsets for all subsurface points in a matrix whose
                  (i,j) entry captures the interaction between

                  form and store this matrix. Instead, we propose an
                  efficient algorithm to glean information from the
                  image volume via the action of matrix-vector
                  products with this matrix. We illustrate how this

                  allowed for new computational approaches in the
                  field of seismic data interpolation.  One of the
                  main requirements of exploiting rank-minimization
                  approaches is that the target data set should
                  exhibit a low-rank structure. Seismic frequency
                  slices exhibit low-rank structure at the
                  low-frequencies, but not at the high
                  frequencies. This behavior is due to the increase in
                  oscillations as we move from low to high-frequency
                  slices, even though the energy remains focused
                  around the diagonal. Therefore, interpolation via
                  rank minimization in the high-frequency range
                  requires extended formulations that incorporate
                  low-rank structure. We propose an approach for
                  seismic data interpolation which incorporates the
                  Hierarchical Semi-Separable Structure (HSS) inside
                  rank-regularized least-squares formulations for the
                  missing-trace interpolation problem. The proposed
                  approach is suitable for large scale problems, since
                  it avoids SVD computations and uses a low-rank
                  factorized formulation instead. We illustrate the
                  advantages of the new HSS approach by interpolating
                  a seismic line from the Gulf of Suez and compare the
                  reconstruction with conventional rank minimization.},

                  interpolation and redatuming algorithms rely on on
                  the assumption that seismic records and images
                  permit sparse approximations under certain
                  representations, such as Curvelet
                  coefficients. Recent findings have suggested that
                  for redundant representations (of which Curvelet is
                  an example), the analysis operator that maps the
                  physical signal to coefficients may also play a
                  crucial role in recovering data from incomplete
                  observations. This insight elevates the significance
                  of a question that often goes unaddressed: is it
                  better for the transform-domain sparsity to be
                  achieved through explicit construction of sparse
                  representations (e.g., by thresholding of small
                  transform-domain coefficients), or by demanding that
                  the algorithm return physical signals which produces
                  sparse coefficients when hit with the forward
                  transform? Recent results show that the two
                  approaches give rise to different solutions when the
                  transform is redundant, and that the latter approach
                  imposes a whole new class of constraints. In
                  particular, the number of zero-valued coefficients
                  given by the analysis operator acting on the signal,
                  referred to as its "cosparsity", have an analogous
                  role to the sparsity of the signal in terms of the
                  coefficients. From this framework, a new
                  reconstruction algorithm is proposed which may allow
                  better reconstruction from subsampled signaled than
                  what the sparsity assumption alone would predict. In
                  this work we apply the new framework and algorithm
                  to the case of seismic data interpolation under the
                  curvelet domain, and show that it admits better
                  reconstruction than some existing L1 sparsity-based
                  methods derived from compressive sensing for a range
                  of subsampling factors. We will also investigate

                  seismic data. However, if correctly used, they can
                  provide valuable information about the
                  subsurface. In this presentation, I will talk about
                  how to make use of multiples in $\ell_1$ regularized
                  least-squares imaging, and how to estimate the
                  source wavelet on the fly using multiples. Synthetic
                  examples show that using multiples not only helps to
                  retrieve the true-amplitude seismic image and the
                  source wavelet, it also increases the wavenumber
                  contents in the seismic image. By using
                  dimensionality reduction techniques with
                  rerandomization, we also greatly decrease the

                  problem. This problem is challenging mostly because
                  of its prohibitive computational cost. To address
                  the issue, dimensionality reduction techniques were
                  proposed in the literature. However, the solution of
                  the reduced problem can deviate from that of the

  year         = {2012},
  organization = {SINBAD},
  abstract     = {Seismic surveys amass large and incomplete data
                  sets, and designing algorithms to interpolate the
                  missing data at very large scales poses a daunting
                  and critical challenge.  We study how to apply
                  scalable matrix completion methods to such
                  interpolation problems.  Recent studies in matrix
                  completion have shown that a matrix that has low
                  rank can be exactly completed when only a small
                  number of observations are available. However, there
                  are two challenges to applying matrix completion to
                  seismic data. Matrix completion is typically applied
                  to two dimensional or dyadic data whereas seismic
                  data is often tensorial. Also successful matrix
                  completion requires a low-rank matrix structure. We
                  address these problems by organizing the seismic
                  data on a matrix grid which exhibits a low-rank
                  structure. This encoding allows us to apply the
                  Jellyfish algorithm, developed at the University of
                  Wisconsin, which achieves state-of-the-art
                  performance for large-scale matrix completion. The
                  proposed framework makes it possible to complete
                  high-SNR interpolations of gigabytes of 4-D seismic
                  data in minutes on standard multicore
                  workstations. Our preliminary experimental results
                  suggest that matrix completion provides a promising
                  new approach to the seismic data interpolation
                  problem.},

                  computing community in the last couple of years
                  which tries to extend notions of linear algebra
                  (rank, the SVD, linear systems, etc.) to higher
                  dimensional arrays, or tensors. Much work has been
                  proposed to try to overcome the so called "curse of
                  dimensionality", the O(N^d) storage required for a
                  d-dimensional array, where N is the size of each
                  dimension. The hierarchical Tucker format is one
                  such tensor representation which manages to
                  decompose a hierarchy of dimensions into parameter
                  matrices of very manageable size, requiring at most
                  dNK + (d - 2)K^3 + K^2 parameters, where K is an
                  internal rank parameter. In this work, we extend
                  ideas of matrix completion to the tensor case, where
                  we only know a small number of randomly distributed
                  entries from various 4D frequency slices, and try to
                  recover the fully sampled tensor based on the
                  knowledge that it has low hierarchical tucker rank
                  in a particular arrangement of dimensions. Using
                  this approach, we exploit the multi-dimensional
                  dependencies within the full data in order to
                  achieve very promising interpolation results even

                  sophisticated algorithms that require multiple paths
                  through all data. This requirement leads to problems
                  because the size of seismic data volumes is
                  increasing exponentially, exposing bottlenecks in IO
                  and computational capability. To overcome these
                  bottlenecks, we follow recent trends in machine
                  learning and compressive sensing by proposing a

                  will reveal velocity errors by de-focusing and can

                  ingredient in seismic full waveform inversion
                  (FWI). Simulation in the time domain and solution of
                  the wave equation in the frequency domain are two
                  competing approaches to modelling. Frequency domain
                  approaches can further be categorized as using
                  either direct or iterative solvers. For 3D FWI,
                  iterative solvers in the frequency domain are
                  attractive, partly because they require less memory
                  than the other methods. This is due to the fact that
                  there is no need to store the wavefield at each time
                  step, or compute a factorization of the Helmholtz
                  operator that will not be as sparse as the original
                  matrix. One iterative solver that has been applied
                  to the Helmholtz equation is CARP-CG. CARP-CG uses
                  Kaczmarz row projections for each block of a domain
                  decomposition scheme to precondition the Helmholtz
                  system into being symmetric and positive
                  semidefinite. The method of conjugate gradients is
                  then used to solve the preconditioned system. We
                  present a comparison of the performance of CARP-CG
                  implemented in several languages (MATLAB, C,
                  FORTRAN, julia) and in two different hardware
                  environments: the LIMA HPC cluster hosted at UBC,
                  and the Checkers cluster which is part of the
                  Westgrid consortium. Parallelization of the
                  algorithm via domain decomposition implemented with
                  MPI (distributed memory) and OMP (shared memory) is
                  also examined.},

  organization = {SINBAD},

                  anisotropic 3D acoustic full-waveform inversion. We
                  demonstrate this scheme on a field data set,
                  applying it to a four-component ocean-bottom survey
                  over the Tommeliten Alpha field in the North
                  Sea. This shallow-water data set provides good
                  azimuthal coverage to offsets of 7 km, with reduced
                  coverage to a maximum offset of about 11 km. The
                  reservoir lies at the crest of a high-velocity
                  antiformal chalk section, overlain by about 3000 m
                  of clastics within which a low-velocity gas cloud
                  produces a seismic obscured area. We inverted only
                  the hydrophone data, and we retained free-surface
                  multiples and ghosts within the field data. We
                  invert in six narrow frequency bands, in the range 3
                  to 6.5 Hz.  At each iteration, we selected only a
                  subset of sources, using a different subset at each
                  iteration; this strategy is more efficient than
                  inverting all the data every iteration. Our starting
                  velocity model was obtained using standard PSDM
                  model building including anisotropic reflection
                  tomography, and contained epsilon values as high as
                  20%.  We have also attempted full-elastic inversion
                  of these data to recover a shallow isotropic model
                  of both p and s-wave velocities. The final FWI
                  velocity model shows a network of shallow
                  high-velocity channels that match similar features
                  in the reflection data. Deeper in the section, the
                  FWI velocity model reveals a sharper and
                  more-intense low-velocity region associated with the
                  gas cloud in which low-velocity fingers match the
                  location of gas-filled faults visible in the
                  reflection data. The resulting velocity model
                  provides a better match to well logs, and better
                  flattens common image gathers, than does the
                  starting model. Reverse-time migration, using the
                  FWI velocity model, provides significant uplift to
                  the migrated image, simplifying the planform of the
                  reservoir section at depth. The workflows, inversion
                  strategy, and algorithms that we have used have
                  broad application to invert a wide-range of
                  analogous field data sets.},

  abstract     = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) can be considered as a
                  controlled data fitting process, in which we
                  approximately fit observed data by iteratively
                  updating the initial velocity model, we expect the
                  final model can reveal subsurface structure till the
                  wavefield misfit can converge to designed tolerance.
                  The conventional FWI approach is expensive since it
                  requires the inversion of a linear system, which
                  involves extremely large multi-experiment data
                  volumes. To overcome this issue we percent a
                  curvetlet based sparsity-promoting Gauss-Newton
                  inversion method. In this presentation we invert for
                  the model updates by replacing the normal
                  Gauss-Newton linearized subproblem for subsampled
                  FWI with a sparsity promoting FWI formulation. We
                  speed up the algorithm and avoid over fitting the
                  data by solving the problem approximately. Aside
                  from this, we control wavefield dispersion by
                  gradually increasing grid size as we move to higher
                  frequencies. Our approach is successful because it
                  reduces the size of seismic data volumes without
                  loss of information. With this reduction, we can
                  compute a Newton-like update with the reduced data
                  volume at the cost of roughly one gradient update
                  for the fully sampled wavefield.},

                  "weighted" algorithms to recover sparse signals from
                  few linear, non-adaptive measurements. The general
                  principle here is to use prior knowledge about the
                  signal to be recovered, e.g., approximate locations
                  of large-in-magnitude transform coefficients, if
                  such information is available. An example for this

                  improve wavefield reconstruction from randomized
                  (sub)sampling. We will review these results and

                  analysis-based recovery (see Hargreaves's talk), and
                  a weighted randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for solving
                  large overdetermined systems of equations that are
                  known to admit a (nearly) sparse solution. Various
                  examples in seismic will be shown.},
