  abstract = {In this work, we develop optimization algorithms on the
                  manifold of Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensors, an
                  extremely efficient format for representing
                  high-dimensional tensors exhibiting particular
                  low-rank structure. With some minor alterations to
                  existing theoretical developments, we develop an
                  optimization framework based on the geometric
                  understanding of HT tensors as a smooth manifold, a
                  generalization of smooth curves/surfaces. Building
                  on the existing research of solving optimization
                  problems on smooth manifolds, we develop Steepest
                  Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods for HT
                  tensors. The resulting algorithms converge quickly,
                  are immediately parallelizable, and do not require
                  the computation of SVDs. We also derive efficient
                  Gauss-Newton based algorithms which converge much
                  faster than standard, first-order methods. We also
                  extend ideas about favourable sampling conditions
                  for missing-data recovery from the field of Matrix
                  Completion to Tensor Completion and demonstrate how
                  the organization of data can affect the success of
                  recovery. As a result, if one has data with randomly
                  missing source pairs, using these ideas, coupled
                  with an efficient solver, one can interpolate
                  large-scale seismic data volumes with missing
                  sources and/or receivers by exploiting the
                  multidimensional dependencies in the data. We are
                  able to recover data volumes amidst extremely high
                  subsampling ratios (in some cases, > 75%) using this
                  approach and we demonstrate our recovery on a
                  synthetic 5D data set provided to us by BG.},

  organization = {SINBAD},
  abstract     = {Seismic surveys amass large and incomplete data
                  sets, and designing algorithms to interpolate the
                  missing data at very large scales poses a daunting
                  and critical challenge.  We study how to apply
                  scalable matrix completion methods to such
                  interpolation problems.  Recent studies in matrix
                  completion have shown that a matrix that has low
                  rank can be exactly completed when only a small
                  number of observations are available. However, there
                  are two challenges to applying matrix completion to
                  seismic data. Matrix completion is typically applied
                  to two dimensional or dyadic data whereas seismic
                  data is often tensorial. Also successful matrix
                  completion requires a low-rank matrix structure. We
                  address these problems by organizing the seismic
                  data on a matrix grid which exhibits a low-rank
                  structure. This encoding allows us to apply the
                  Jellyfish algorithm, developed at the University of
                  Wisconsin, which achieves state-of-the-art
                  performance for large-scale matrix completion. The
                  proposed framework makes it possible to complete
                  high-SNR interpolations of gigabytes of 4-D seismic
                  data in minutes on standard multicore
                  workstations. Our preliminary experimental results
                  suggest that matrix completion provides a promising

                  (rank, the SVD, linear systems, etc.) to higher
                  dimensional arrays, or tensors. Much work has been
                  proposed to try to overcome the so called "curse of
                  dimensionality", the O(N^d) storage required for a
                  d-dimensional array, where N is the size of each
                  dimension. The hierarchical Tucker format is one
                  such tensor representation which manages to
                  decompose a hierarchy of dimensions into parameter
                  matrices of very manageable size, requiring at most

                  because the size of seismic data volumes is
                  increasing exponentially, exposing bottlenecks in IO
                  and computational capability. To overcome these
                  bottlenecks, we follow recent trends in machine
                  learning and compressive sensing by proposing a
                  sparsity-promoting inversion technique that works on
                  small randomized subsets of data only. We boost the
                  performance of this algorithm significantly by
                  modifying a state-of-the-art l1-norm solver to

                  will reveal velocity errors by de-focusing and can
                  thus be used for velocity analysis. However, for
                  optimal sensitivity to velocity errors, the
                  subsurface offset has to be aligned with the local
                  dip. As this dip is not known a priori, we consider
                  forming the extended image for subsurface offsets in

                  image primaries and multiples simultaneously that
                  yields an artifact-free image. To address the high
                  computational cost associated with inversion, we
                  propose to: i) have the wave-equation solver carry
                  out the multi-dimensional convolutions implicitly,
                  and ii) reduce the number of PDE solves by
                  randomized subsampling. We then propose to improve
                  the overall performance of this algorithm by a
                  process called rerandomization, which helps to
                  cancel the correlation built between model iterate
                  and the subsampling operator. We show the merits of
                  our approach on a number of examples.},

                  significant step is the repeatability of the

                  must be placed at the exact location as they were,
                  during baseline survey and acquisition. This
                  condition is required to be able to produce an image
                  of the same location over time and this enhances a
                  proper reservoir characterization. The cost of
                  repeating the seismic acquisition is very expensive,
                  as geophones (receivers) have to be left at the same
                  location over the period for which the data will be
                  acquired. In this talk, we attempt to highlight the

                  condition of repeatability of the acquisition . We
                  show that a random sampling of the shots or random
                  placement of the geophones is able to reproduce the

                  components. This allows modeling in general

                  the wave equation in the frequency domain are two
                  competing approaches to modelling. Frequency domain
                  approaches can further be categorized as using
                  either direct or iterative solvers. For 3D FWI,
                  iterative solvers in the frequency domain are
                  attractive, partly because they require less memory
                  than the other methods. This is due to the fact that
                  there is no need to store the wavefield at each time
                  step, or compute a factorization of the Helmholtz
                  operator that will not be as sparse as the original
                  matrix. One iterative solver that has been applied
                  to the Helmholtz equation is CARP-CG. CARP-CG uses
                  Kaczmarz row projections for each block of a domain

                  applying it to a four-component ocean-bottom survey
                  over the Tommeliten Alpha field in the North
                  Sea. This shallow-water data set provides good
                  azimuthal coverage to offsets of 7 km, with reduced
                  coverage to a maximum offset of about 11 km. The
                  reservoir lies at the crest of a high-velocity
                  antiformal chalk section, overlain by about 3000 m
                  of clastics within which a low-velocity gas cloud
                  produces a seismic obscured area. We inverted only
                  the hydrophone data, and we retained free-surface
                  multiples and ghosts within the field data. We
                  invert in six narrow frequency bands, in the range 3
                  to 6.5 Hz.  At each iteration, we selected only a
                  subset of sources, using a different subset at each
                  iteration; this strategy is more efficient than
                  inverting all the data every iteration. Our starting
                  velocity model was obtained using standard PSDM
                  model building including anisotropic reflection
                  tomography, and contained epsilon values as high as
                  20%.  We have also attempted full-elastic inversion
                  of these data to recover a shallow isotropic model
                  of both p and s-wave velocities. The final FWI
                  velocity model shows a network of shallow
                  high-velocity channels that match similar features
                  in the reflection data. Deeper in the section, the
                  FWI velocity model reveals a sharper and
                  more-intense low-velocity region associated with the
                  gas cloud in which low-velocity fingers match the
                  location of gas-filled faults visible in the
                  reflection data. The resulting velocity model
                  provides a better match to well logs, and better
                  flattens common image gathers, than does the
                  starting model. Reverse-time migration, using the
                  FWI velocity model, provides significant uplift to
                  the migrated image, simplifying the planform of the
                  reservoir section at depth. The workflows, inversion
                  strategy, and algorithms that we have used have
                  broad application to invert a wide-range of

                  wavefield misfit can converge to designed tolerance.
                  The conventional FWI approach is expensive since it
                  requires the inversion of a linear system, which
                  involves extremely large multi-experiment data
                  volumes. To overcome this issue we percent a
                  curvetlet based sparsity-promoting Gauss-Newton
                  inversion method. In this presentation we invert for
                  the model updates by replacing the normal

                  gradually increasing grid size as we move to higher
                  frequencies. Our approach is successful because it
                  reduces the size of seismic data volumes without
                  loss of information. With this reduction, we can
                  compute a Newton-like update with the reduced data
