  abstract = {In [Erlangga and Nabben, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. (2007), to appear],
	a multilevel Krylov method is proposed to solve linear systems with
	symmetric and nonsymmetric matrix of coefficients. This multilevel
	method is developed based on shifting (or projecting) some small
	eigen- values to the largest eigenvalue, leading to a more favorable
	spectrum for convergence acceleration of a Krylov subspace method.
	Such a projection is insensitive with respect to the approximation
	of the small eigenvalues to be projected, which for a particular
	choice of deflation subspaces is equivalent to solving a coarse-grid
	problem analogue to multigrid. Different from multigrid, in the multilevel
	Krylov method, however, the coarse-grid problem is solved by a Krylov
	method, whose convergence rate is further accelerated by applying
	projection to the coarse-grid system. A recursive application of
	projection and coarse-grid solve by a Krylov iterative method then
	leads to the multilevel Krylov method. The method has been successfully
	applied to 2D convection-diffusion problems for which a standard
	multigrid method fails to converge. In this paper, we extend this
	multilevel Krylov method to indefinite linear systems arising from
	a discretization of the Helmholtz equation, preconditioned by shifted
	Laplacian as introduced by [Erlangga, Oosterlee and Vuik, SIAM J.
	Sci. Comput. 27(2006), pp. 1471Ð1492]. Since in this case projection
	must be applied to the preconditioned system AM?1, the coarse-grid
	matrices are approximated by a product of some low dimension matrices
	associated with A and M. Within the Krylov iteration and projection
	step in each coarse-grid solve, a multigrid iteration is used to
	approximately invert the preconditioner. Hence, a multigrid-multilevel
	Krylov method results. Numerical results are given for high wavenumbers
	and show the effectiveness of the method for solving Helmholtz problems.
	Not only can the convergence be made almost independent of grid size
	h, but also only mildly independent of wavenumber k.},

	a sparsity-promoting approach},
  institution = {UBC Earth and Ocean Sciences Department},
  year = {2010},
  number = {TR-2010-2},
  abstract = {Seismic data are typically irregularly sampled along spatial axes.
	This irregular sampling may adversely affect some key steps, e.g.,
	multiple prediction/attenuation or imaging, in the processing workflow.
	To overcome this problem almost every large dataset is regularized
	and/or interpolated. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we extend
	our earlier work on the nonequispaced fast discrete curvelet transform
	(NFDCT) and introduce a second generation of the transform. This
	new generation differs from the previous one by the approach taken
	to compute accurate curvelet coefficients from irregularly sampled
	data. The first generation relies on accurate Fourier coefficients
	obtained by an $\ell_2$-regularized inversion of the nonequispaced
	fast Fourier transform, while the second is based on a direct, $\ell_1$
	-regularized inversion of the operator that links curvelet coefficients
	to irregular data. Also, by construction, the NFDCT second generation
	is lossless, unlike the NFDCT first generation. This property is
	particularly attractive for processing irregularly sampled seismic
	data in the curvelet domain and bringing them back to their irregular
	recording locations with high fidelity. Secondly, we combine the
	NFDCT second generation with the standard fast discrete curvelet
	transform (FDCT) to form a new curvelet-based method, coined nonequispaced
	curvelet reconstruction with sparsity-promoting inversion (NCRSI),
	for the regularization and interpolation of irregularly sampled data.
	We demonstrate that, for a pure regularization problem, the reconstruction
	is very accurate. The signal-to-reconstruction error ratio is, in
	our example, above 40 dB. We also conduct combined interpolation
	and regularization experiments. The reconstructions for synthetic
	data are accurate, particularly when the recording locations are
	optimally jittered. The reconstruction in our real data example shows
	amplitudes along the main wavefronts smoothly varying with no obvious
	acquisition imprint; a result very competitive with results from
	other reconstruction methods overall.},

	idea is to replace all sequential sources by a small number of simultaneous
	sources. This introduces random crosstalk in the model updates and
	special stochastic optimization strategies are required to deal with
	this. Two problems arise with this approach: i) source encoding can
	only be applied to fixed-spread acquisition setups, and ii) stochastic
	optimization methods tend to converge very slowly, relying on averaging
	to get rid of the cross-talk. Although the slow convergence is partly
	offset by the low iteration cost, we show that conventional optimization

	minimization provides an accurate support estimate. We then derive
	stability and robustness guarantees for the weighted -$\ell_1$ minimization
	problem with more than one support estimate. We show that applying
	a smaller weight to support estimate that enjoy higher accuracy improves
	the recovery conditions compared with the case of a single support
	estimate and the case with standard, i.e., non-weighted,-$\ell_1$
	minimization. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical
	simulations on synthetic signals and real audio signals.},

  abstract = {The tasks of sampling, compression and reconstruction are very common
	and often necessary in seismic data processing due to the large size
	of seismic data. Curvelet-based Recovery by Sparsity-promoting Inversion,
	motivated by the newly developed theory of compressive sensing, is
	among the best recovery strategies for seismic data. The incomplete
	data input to this curvelet-based recovery is determined by randomized
	sampling of the original complete data. Unlike usual regular undersampling,
	randomized sampling can convert aliases to easy-to-eliminate noise,
	thus facilitating the process of reconstruction of the complete data
	from the incomplete data. Randomized sampling methods such as jittered
	sampling have been developed in the past that are suitable for curvelet-based
	recovery, however most have only been applied to sampling in one
	dimension. Considering that seismic datasets are usually higher dimensional
	and extremely large, in the present paper, we extend the 1D version
	of jittered sampling to two dimensions, both with underlying Cartesian
	and hexagonal grids. We also study separable and non-separable two
	dimensional jittered sampling, the former referring to the Kronecker
	product of two one-dimensional jittered samplings. These different
	categories of jittered sampling are compared against one another
	in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality, from which
	we find that jittered hexagonal sampling is better than jittered
	Cartesian sampling, while fully non-separable jittered sampling is
	better than separable sampling. Because in the image processing and
	computer graphics literature, sampling patterns with blue-noise spectra
	are found to be ideal to avoid aliasing, we also introduce two other
	randomized sampling methods, possessing sampling spectra with beneficial
	blue noise characteristics, Poisson Disk sampling and Farthest Point
	sampling. We compare these methods, and apply the introduced sampling
	methodologies to higher dimensional curvelet-based reconstruction.
	These sampling schemes are shown to lead to better results from CRSI
	compared to the other more traditional sampling protocols, e.g. regular
	subsampling.},

  abstract = {Successful removal of coherent noise sources greatly determines the
	quality of seismic imaging. Major advances were made in this direction,
	e.g., Surface-Related Multiple Elimination (SRME) and interferometric
	ground-roll removal. Still, moderate phase, timing, amplitude errors
	and clutter in the predicted signal components can be detrimental.
	Adopting a Bayesian approach along with the assumption of approximate
	curvelet-domain independence of the to-be-separated signal components,
	we construct an iterative algorithm that takes the predictions produced
	by for example SRME as input and separates these components in a
	robust fashion. In addition, the proposed algorithm controls the
	energy mismatch between the separated and predicted components. Such
	a control, which was lacking in earlier curvelet-domain formulations,
	produces improved results for primary-multiple separation on both
	synthetic and real data.},
