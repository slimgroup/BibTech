  abstract = {Common image gathers are used in building velocity
                  models, inverting for anisotropy parameters, and
                  analyzing reservoir attributes. Typically, only
                  primary reflections are used to form image gathers
                  as multiples can cause artifacts that interfere with
                  the events of interest. However, it has been shown
                  that multiples can actually provide extra
                  illumination of the subsurface, especially for
                  delineating the near-surface features. In this
                  paper, we aim to form common image gathers directly
                  from the data with surface related multiples by
                  applying concepts that have been used to
                  successfully deal with surface-related multiples in
                  imaging. We achieve this by effectively inverting an
                  extended migration operator. This results in
                  extended images with better near-surface
                  illumination that are free of artifacts that can
                  hamper velocity analysis. In addition, being able to
                  generate extended images directly from the total
                  data avoids the need for (time-consuming)
                  pre-processing. Synthetic examples on a layered
                  model show that the proposed formulation is
                  promising.},

                  single (or multiple) source vessel fires at --
                  jittered source locations and instances in time. It
                  has been shown in the past that this problem can be
                  setup as a -- compressed sensing problem, where
                  conventional seismic data is reconstructed from
                  blended data via a sparsity-promoting optimization
                  formulation. While the recovery quality of deblended
                  data is very good, the recovery process is
                  computationally very expensive. In this paper, we
                  present a computationally efficient
                  rank-minimization algorithm to deblend the seismic
                  data. The proposed algorithm is suitable for
                  large-scale seismic data, since it avoids SVD
                  computations and uses a low-rank factorized
                  formulation instead. Results are illustrated with
                  simulations of time-jittered marine acquisition,
                  which translates to jittered source locations for a
                  given speed of the source vessel, for a single

                  within a physically realistic range. Synthetic
                  experiments show that including total variation

                  Total variation-like constraints can make the

  abstract = {Least-squares seismic migration (LSM) is a wave equation based linearized inversion problem relying on the minimization of a least-squares misfit function, with respect to the medium perturbation, between recorded and modeled wavefields. Today‚Äôs challenges in Hydrocarbon ex- ploration are to build high resolution images of more and more complicated geological reservoirs, which requires to handle very large systems of equations. The extreme size of the problem com- bined with the fact that it is ill-conditioned make LSM not yet feasible for industrial purposes. To overcome this "curse of dimensionality", dimension reduction and divide-and-conquer tech- niques that aim to decrease the computation time and the required memory, while conserving the image quality, have recently been developed. By borrowing ideas from stochastic optimiza- tion and compressive sensing, the imaging problem is reformulated as an L1-regularized, sparsity promoted LSM. The idea is to take advantage of the compressibility of the model perturbation in the curvelet domain and to work on series of smaller subproblems each involving a small ran- domized subset of data. We try two different subset sampling strategies, artificial randomized simultaneous sources experiments ("supershots") and drawing sequential shots firing at random source locations. These subsets are changed after each subproblem is solved. In both cases we obtain good migration results at significantly reduced computational cost. Application of these methods to a complicated synthetic model yields to encouraging results, underlining the usefulness of sparsity promotion and randomization in time stepping formulation.

                  chain Monte Carlo (McMC) method to quantify the

                  formulate the uncertainty quantification problem in
                  the framework of the Bayesian inference, which
                  formulates the posterior probability as the
                  conditional probability of the model given the
                  observed data. The Metropolis-Hasting algorithm is
                  used to generate samples satisfying the posterior
                  probability density function (pdf) to quantify the
                  uncertainty. However it suffers from the challenge
                  to construct a proposal distribution that
                  simultaneously provides a good representation of the
                  true posterior pdf and is easy to manipulate. To
                  address this challenge, we propose a stochastic
                  quasi-Newton McMC method, which relies on the fact
                  that the Hessian of the deterministic problem is
                  equivalent to the inverse of the covariance matrix
                  of the posterior pdf. The l-BFGS (limited-memory
                  Broyden‚ÄìFletcher‚ÄìGoldfarb‚ÄìShanno) Hessian is used to
                  approximate the inverse of the covariance matrix
                  efficiently, and the randomized source sub-sampling
                  strategy is used to reduce the computational cost of
                  evaluating the posterior pdf and constructing the
                  l-BFGS Hessian. Numerical experiments show the
                  capability of this stochastic quasi-Newton McMC
                  method to quantify the uncertainty of FWI with a
                  considerable low cost.},

                  techniques has been recently introduced in the
                  seismic community. All the existing
                  rank-minimization techniques assume the recording
                  locations to be on a regular grid, e.g. sampled
                  periodically, but seismic data are typically
                  irregularly sampled along spatial axes. Other than
                  the irregularity of the sampled grid, we often have
                  missing data. In this paper, we study the effect of
                  grid irregularity to conduct matrix completion on a
                  regular grid for unstructured data. We propose an

  abstract = {As we entered the second half of the DNOISE II project,
                  we are happy to report that we have made significant
                  progress on several fronts. Firstly, our work on
                  seismic data acquisition with compressive sensing is
                  becoming widely recognized. For instance,
                  ConocoPhilips ran a highly successful field trial on
                  Marine acquisition with compressive sensing and
                  obtained significant improvements compared to
                  standard production (see figure below). Moreover,
                  one of the main outcomes of this year‚Äôs EAGE
                  workshop was that industry is ready to adapt
                  randomized sampling as a new acquisition
                  paradigm. Needless to say this is a big success for
                  what we have been trying to accomplish with DNOISE
                  II. Finally, we have made a breakthrough in the
                  application of randomized sampling in 4-D seismic,
                  which is receiving a lot of interest from
                  industry. Secondly, our work on large-scale
                  optimization in the context of wave-equation based
                  inversion is also increasingly widely adapted. For
                  instance, our batching techniques are making the
                  difference between making a loss or profit for a
                  large contractor company active in the area of
                  full-waveform inversion. We also continued to make
                  progress in exciting new directions that go beyond
                  sparsity promotion and which allow us to exploit
                  other types of structure within the data, such as
                  low-rank for matrices or hierarchical Tucker formats
                  for tensors. Application of these techniques show
                  excellent results and in certain cases, such as
                  source separation problems with small dithering,
                  show significant improvements over transform-domain
                  methods. Thirdly, we continued to make significant
                  progress in wave-equation based inversion. We
                  extended our new penalty-based formulation now
                  called Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion/Imaging to
                  include total-variation regularization and density
                  variations. We also continued to make progress on
                  multiples, imaging with multiples and 3-D
                  full-waveform inversion. Statoil is the latest
                  company to join and we have several other companies
                  that have shown a keen interest. We also received
                  substantial in-kind contributions including a
                  license to WesternGeco‚Äôs iOmega and HPC equipment
                  discounts. After many years of support BP decided
                  unfortunately to no longer support SINBAD quoting
                  financial headwind related to the Deep horizon
                  disaster. On a more positive note, we are extremely
                  happy to report major progress on our efforts to
                  secure access to high-performance compute, including
                  renewed funding from NSERC and our involvement in
                  the International Inversion Initiative in Brazil. 9
                  peer-reviewed journal publications have resulted
                  from our work within the reporting period, with a
                  further 6 submitted, and DNOISE members disseminated
                  the results of our research at 49 major national and
                  international conference presentations. On the HQP
                  training side, 4 MSc students have recently
                  graduated, with one obtaining a position with CGG
                  Calgary, and we added 4 postdocs and 3 PhD students
                  to our team in September 2014, greatly increasing
                  our research capacity. As can be seen from the
                  report below, we are well on schedule and on certain
                  topics well beyond the milestones included in the
                  original proposal. With the purchase of the new
                  cluster we expect to see a surge of activity in
                  extending our algorithms to 3D. With this increased
                  capacity, we continue to be in an excellent position
                  to make fundamental contributions to the fields of
                  seismic data acquisition, processing, and
                  wave-equation based inversion. In the sections
                  below, we give a detailed overview of the research
                  and publication activities of the different members
                  of the group and how these relate to the objectives
                  of the grant, to industrial uptake, and to
                  outreach. Unless stated otherwise the students and

  abstract = {The successful application of linearized inversion is
                  affected by the prohibitive size of the data,
                  computational resources required, and how accurately
                  the model parameters reflects the real Earth
                  properties. The issue of data size and computational
                  resources can be addressed by combining ideas from
                  sparsity promoting and stochastic optimization,
                  which can allow us to invert model perturbation with
                  a small subset of the data, yielding a few PDE
                  solves for the inversion. In this abstract, we are
                  aiming at addressing the issue of accuracy of model
                  parameters by inverting density and velocity
                  simultaneously rather than only using velocity. As a
                  matter of face, the effects of density and velocity
                  variations towards the wavefield are very similar,
                  which will cause energy leakage between density and
                  velocity images. To overcome this issue, we proposed
                  a incoherence enhanced method that can reduce the
                  similarity between the effect of density and
                  velocity. Moreover, the location of structural
                  variations in velocity and density are often
                  overlapped in geological setting, thus in this
                  abstract, we also exploit this property with
                  joint-sparsity promoting to further improve the
                  imaging result.},

  abstract = {In time-lapse or 4D seismics, repeatability of the
                  acquisition is a very crucial step, as we do not
                  want spurious events that are not there. In this
                  paper, we propose an approach which avoids any
                  requirement to repeat the surveys, by using
                  randomized sampling technique which allows us to be
                  more efficient in the acquisition. Our method
                  applies to sampling data using ocean bottom nodes
                  (OBN) as receivers. We test the efficacy of our
                  proposed randomized acquisition geometry for
                  time-lapse survey on two different models. In the
                  first example, model properties does not change with
                  time, while in the second example, model exhibit a
                  time-lapse effect which may be caused by the
                  migration of fluid within the reservoir. We perform
                  two types of randomized sampling - uniform
                  randomized sampling and jittered sampling to
                  visualize the effects of non-repeatability in

                  randomized sampling is a more efficient method

                  requirement to control the maximum spacing between

                  progress on several fronts. Firstly, our work on
                  seismic data acquisition with compressive sensing is
                  becoming widely recognized, reflected in adaptations
                  of this technology by industry and in this year‚Äôs
                  SEG Karcher award, which went to Gilles Hennenfent,
                  who was one of the researchers who started working
                  in this area in our group. As this report shows, we
                  continued to make progress on this topic with
                  numerous presentations, publications, and software
                  releases. Secondly, our work on large-scale
                  optimization is also widely adapted and instrumental
                  to the different research areas on the grant. In
                  particular, we are excited about new directions that
                  go beyond sparsity promotion and which allow us to
                  exploit other types of structure within the data,
                  such as low-rank. Over the near future, we expect to
                  see a body of new research based on these findings
                  touching acquisition as well as the wave-equation
                  based inversion aspects of our research
                  program. Thirdly, we are also very happy to report
                  that we continued to make substantial progress in
                  wave-equation base inversion. In particular, we
                  would like to mention successes in the areas of
                  acceleration of sparsity-promoting imaging with
                  source estimation and multiples and in theoretical
                  as well as practical aspects of full-waveform
                  inversion. We derived a highly practical and
                  economic formulation of 3-D FWI and we also came up
                  with a complete new formulation of FWI, which
                  mitigates issues related to cycle skipping. Finally,
                  we made a lot of progress applying our algorithm to
                  industrial datasets, which has been well received by
                  industry. Our findings show that FWI is still an
                  immature technology calling for more theoretical
                  input and for the development of practical
                  workflows. Over the last year our work cumulated in
                  14 peer-reviewed journal publications, 5 submitted
                  journal publications, 13 (+ 9) extended abstracts,
                  32 talks at international conferences, and 6
                  software packages. Finally, we are happy to report
                  that we have been joined by several new companies,
                  namely, ION Geophysical, CGG, and Woodside. At this
                  midpoint of the Grant, we are also happy to report
                  that we are well on schedule to meet the milestones
                  included in the original proposal. Given our wide
                  range of expertise and our plans to replace our
                  compute cluster, we continue to be in an excellent
                  position to make fundamental contributions to the
                  fields of seismic data acquisition, processing, and
                  wave-equation based inversion.},

                  optimization problems based on a penalty
                  formulation. This method aims to combine advantages
                  of both full-space and reduced methods by exploiting
                  a large search-space (consisting of both control and
                  state variables) while allowing for an efficient
                  implementation that avoids storing and updating the
                  state-variables. This leads to a method that has
                  roughly the same per-iteration complexity as
                  conventional reduced approaches while dening an
                  objective that is less non-linear in the control
                  variable by implicitly relaxing the constraint. We
                  apply the method to a seismic inverse problem where
                  it leads to a particularly ecient implementation
                  when compared to a conventional reduced approach as
                  it avoids the use of adjoint
                  state-variables. Numerical examples illustrate the
                  approach and suggest that the proposed formulation
                  can indeed mitigate some of the well-known problems
                  with local minima in the seismic inverse problem.},

                  downside of current state of the art techniques is
                  their reliance on the SVD of seismic data

                  circumvent this problem by working with matrix

                  penalization, and successfully apply it to the

                  typical size of the problems in 3D applications
                  precludes the use of direct factorization to solve
                  the equation and hence iterative methods are used in
                  practice. For higher wavenumbers, the system becomes
                  increasingly indefinite and thus good

                  the spatial bandwidth and aperture of seismic data;
                  [2] Removal of the 'surface nonlinearity' by
                  simultaneous estimation of the source signature and
                  the surface-free Green's function by inverting the
                  surface-related multiple prediction operator; [3]
                  Reduction of the computational complexity of
                  full-waveform inversion (FWI) by randomized
                  dimensionality reduction; [4] "Convexification" of

                  effects of non-uniqueness that has plagued FWI since

                  computational costs of processing and inverting
                  data, and to issues with source calibration and
                  surface-related multiples. The final theme is more
                  'blue sky' and tries to incorporate ideas from
                  migration-velocity analysis into the formulation of
                  full-waveform inversion. Aside from these themes, we

  abstract = {In this paper, we offer an alternative sampling method
                  leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing
                  towards seismic acquisition and processing for data
                  that are traditionally considered to be
                  undersampled. The main outcome of this approach is a
                  new technology where acquisition and processing
                  related costs are no longer determined by overly
                  stringent sampling criteria, such as Nyquist. At the
                  heart of our approach lies randomized incoherent
                  sampling that breaks subsampling related
                  interferences by turning them into harmless noise,
                  which we subsequently remove by promoting
                  transform-domain sparsity. Now, costs no longer grow
                  with resolution and dimensionality of the survey
                  area, but instead depend on transform-domain
                  sparsity only. Our contribution is twofold. First,
                  we demonstrate by means of carefully designed
                  numerical experiments that compressive sensing can
                  successfully be adapted to seismic
                  acquisition. Second, we show that accurate recovery
                  can be accomplished for compressively sampled data
                  volumes sizes that exceed the size of conventional
                  transform-domain data volumes by only a small
                  factor. Because compressive sensing combines
                  transformation and encoding by a single linear
                  encoding step, this technology is directly
                  applicable to acquisition and to dimensionality
                  reduction during processing. In either case,
                  sampling, storage, and processing costs scale with
                  transform-domain sparsity.},

                  Seismic Exploration is a multidisciplinary research
                  project that involves faculty from the Mathematics,
                  Computer Science, and Earth and Ocean Sciences
                  Departments at the University of British Columbia.
                  DNOISE II constitutes a transformative research
                  program towards a new paradigm in seismic
                  exploration where the acquisition- and
                  processing-related costs are no longer determined by
                  the survey area and discretization but by
                  transform-domain sparsity of the final result. In
                  this approach, we rid ourselves from the
                  confinements of conventional overly stringent
                  sampling criteria that call for regular sampling
                  with sequentiual sources at Nyquist rates. By
                  adapting the principles of compressive sensing,
                  DNOISE II promotes a ground-up formulation for
                  seismic imaging where adverse subsampling-related
                  artifacts are removed by intelligent
                  simultaneous-acquisition design and recovery by
                  transform-domain sparsity promotion. This
                  development---in conjunction with our track records
                  in sparse recovery and time-harmonic Helmholtz
                  solvers---puts us in an unique position to deliver
                  on fundamental breakthroughs in the development and
                  implementation of the next-generation of processing,
                  imaging, and full-waveform inversion solutions.},

  title = {Design of two-dimensional randomized sampling schemes for curvelet-based sparsity-promoting seismic data recovery},
  institution = {UBC Earth and Ocean Sciences Department},
  year = {2009},
  number = {TR-EOAS-2009-3},
  abstract = {The tasks of sampling, compression and reconstruction
                  are very common and often necessary in seismic data
                  processing due to the large size of seismic
                  data. Curvelet-based Recovery by Sparsity-promoting
                  Inversion, motivated by the newly developed theory
                  of compressive sensing, is among the best recovery
                  strategies for seismic data. The incomplete data
                  input to this curvelet-based recovery is determined
                  by randomized sampling of the original complete
                  data. Unlike usual regular undersampling, randomized
                  sampling can convert aliases to easy-to-eliminate
                  noise, thus facilitating the process of
                  reconstruction of the complete data from the
                  incomplete data. Randomized sampling methods such as
                  jittered sampling have been developed in the past
                  that are suitable for curvelet-based recovery,
                  however most have only been applied to sampling in
                  one dimension. Considering that seismic datasets are
                  usually higher dimensional and extremely large, in
                  the present paper, we extend the 1D version of
                  jittered sampling to two dimensions, both with
                  underlying Cartesian and hexagonal grids. We also
                  study separable and non-separable two dimensional
                  jittered sampling, the former referring to the
                  Kronecker product of two one-dimensional jittered
                  samplings. These different categories of jittered
                  sampling are compared against one another in terms
                  of signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality, from
                  which we find that jittered hexagonal sampling is
                  better than jittered Cartesian sampling, while fully
                  non-separable jittered sampling is better than
                  separable sampling. Because in the image processing
                  and computer graphics literature, sampling patterns
                  with blue-noise spectra are found to be ideal to
                  avoid aliasing, we also introduce two other
                  randomized sampling methods, possessing sampling
                  spectra with beneficial blue noise characteristics,
                  Poisson Disk sampling and Farthest Point
                  sampling. We compare these methods, and apply the
                  introduced sampling methodologies to higher
                  dimensional curvelet-based reconstruction. These
                  sampling schemes are shown to lead to better results
                  from CRSI compared to the other more traditional
                  sampling protocols, e.g. regular subsampling.},

  abstract = {Geophysical inverse problems typically involve a trade
                  off between data misfit and some prior. Pareto
                  curves trace the optimal trade off between these two
                  competing aims. These curves are commonly used in
                  problems with two-norm priors where they are plotted
                  on a log-log scale and are known as L-curves. For
                  other priors, such as the sparsity-promoting one
                  norm, Pareto curves remain relatively
                  unexplored. First, we show how these curves provide
                  an objective criterion to gauge how robust one-norm
                  solvers are when they are limited by a maximum
                  number of matrix-vector products that they can
                  perform. Second, we use Pareto curves and their
                  properties to define and compute one-norm
                  compressibilities. We argue this notion is key to
                  understand one-norm regularized inversion. Third, we
                  illustrate the correlation between the one-norm
                  compressibility and the performance of Fourier and
                  curvelet reconstructions with sparsity promoting
                  inversion.},

                  the least-squares problem only approximately, and a

                  trade-off between the least-squares fit and the
