abstract = {Many seismic exploration techniques rely on the collection of 
massive data volumes that are subsequently mined for information during 
processing. While this approach has been extremely successful in the past, 
current efforts toward higher resolution images in increasingly complicated 
regions of the Earth continue to reveal fundamental shortcomings in our 
workflows. Chiefly amongst these is the so-called “curse of dimensionality” 
exemplified by Nyquist's sampling criterion, which disproportionately 
strains current acquisition and processing systems as the size and desired 
resolution of our survey areas continues to increase. We offer an alternative 
sampling method leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing towards 
seismic acquisition and processing for data that, from a traditional point 
of view, are considered to be undersampled. The main outcome of this approach 
is a new technology where acquisition and processing related costs are 
decoupled the stringent Nyquist sampling criterion. At the heart of our 
approach lies randomized incoherent sampling that breaks subsampling-related 
interferences by turning them into harmless noise, which we subsequently 
remove by promoting sparsity in a transform-domain. Acquisition schemes 
designed to fit into this regime no longer grow significantly in cost with 
increasing resolution and dimensionality of the survey area, but instead 
its cost ideally only depends on transform-domain sparsity of the expected 
data. Our contribution is split into two part.},

  abstract = {Seismic imaging is a linearized inversion problem relying on the 
  minimization of a least-squares misfit functional as a function of the medium 
  perturbation. The success of this procedure hinges on our ability to handle 
  large systems of equations---whose size grows exponentially with the demand 
  for higher resolution images in more and more complicated areas---and our 
  ability to invert these systems given a limited amount of computational 
  resources. To overcome this ``curse of dimensionality'' in problem size and 
  computational complexity, we propose a combination of randomized 
  dimensionality-reduction and divide-and-conquer techniques. This approach 
  allows us to take advantage of sophisticated sparsity-promoting solvers that 
  work on a series of smaller subproblems each involving a small randomized 
  subset of data. These subsets correspond to artificial simultaneous-source 
  experiments made of random superpositions of sequential-source experiments. 
  By changing these subsets after each subproblem is solved, we are able to 
  attain an inversion quality that is competitive while requiring fewer 
  computational, and possibly, fewer acquisition resources. Application of this 
  concept to a controlled series of experiments showed the validity of our 
  approach and the relationship between its efficiency---by reducing the number 
  of sources and hence the number of wave-equation solves---and the image 
  quality. Application of our dimensionality-reduction methodology with sparsity 
  promotion to a complicated synthetic with well-log constrained structure also 
  yields excellent results underlining the importance of sparsity promotion.},

	This new generation differs from the previous one by the approach

	obtained by an l2-regularized inversion of the nonequispaced fast
	Fourier transform (FFT) whereas the second is based on a direct l1-regularized
	inversion of the operator that links curvelet coefficients to irregular
	data. Also, by construction the second generation NFDCT is lossless
	unlike the first generation NFDCT. This property is particularly
	attractive for processing irregularly sampled seismic data in the
	curvelet domain and bringing them back to their irregular record-ing
	locations with high fidelity. Secondly, we combine the second generation
	NFDCT with the standard fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT) to
	form a new curvelet-based method, coined nonequispaced curvelet reconstruction
	with sparsity-promoting inversion (NCRSI) for the regularization
	and interpolation of irregularly sampled data. We demonstrate that
	for a pure regularization problem the reconstruction is very accurate.
	The signal-to-reconstruction error ratio in our example is above
	40 dB. We also conduct combined interpolation and regularization
	experiments. The reconstructions for synthetic data are accurate,
	particularly when the recording locations are optimally jittered.
	The reconstruction in our real data example shows amplitudes along
	the main wavefronts smoothly varying with limited acquisition imprint.},

                  for seismic waveform inversion. The basic principle
                  of such methods is to randomly draw a batch of
                  realizations of a given misfit function and goes
                  back to the 1950s. The ultimate goal of such an
                  approach is to dramatically reduce the computational
                  cost involved in evaluating the misfit. Following
                  earlier work, we introduce the stochasticity in
                  waveform inversion problem in a rigorous way via a
                  technique called randomized trace estimation. We
                  then review theoretical results that underlie recent

	Our work is motivated by empirical observations in the seismic community,
	corroborated by recent results from compressive sampling, which indicate
	favorable (wavefield) reconstructions from random as opposed to regular
	undersampling. As predicted by theory, random undersampling renders
	coherent aliases into harmless incoherent random noise, effectively
	turning the interpolation problem into a much simpler denoising problem.
	A practical requirement of wavefield reconstruction with localized

	random undersampling does not provide such a control and the main
	purpose of this paper is to introduce a sampling scheme, coined jittered

	offering control on the maximum gap size. Our contribution of jittered

	data volumes by recently developed curvelet frames. The elements
	of this transform are multidimensional and directional and locally
	resem- ble wavefronts present in the data, which leads to a compressible
	representation for seismic data. This compression enables us to formulate
	a new curvelet-based seismic data recovery algorithm through sparsity-promoting

	formulation of a re- covery problem, namely a sparsifying transform,
	a sampling strategy that subdues coherent aliases and a sparsity-promoting
	program that recovers the largest entries of the curvelet-domain

	with a stylized experiment that stresses the importance of the degree
	of compression by the sparsifying transform. With these findings,
	a curvelet-based recovery algorithms is developed, which recovers
	seismic wavefields from seismic data volumes with large percentages

	main three ingredients of compressive sampling, namely the curvelet
	compression of seismic data, the existence of a favorable sam- pling
	scheme and the formulation of a large-scale sparsity-promoting solver

  abstract = {In many exploration areas, successful separation of primaries and
	multiples greatly determines the quality of seismic imaging. Despite
	major advances made by surface-related multiple elimination (SRME),
	amplitude errors in the predicted multiples remain a problem. When
	these errors vary for each type of multiple in different ways (as
	a function of offset, time, and dip), they pose a serious challenge
	for conventional least-squares matching and for the recently introduced
	separation by curvelet-domain thresholding. We propose a data-adaptive
	method that corrects amplitude errors, which vary smoothly as a function
	of location, scale (frequency band), and angle. With this method,
	the amplitudes can be corrected by an elementwise curvelet-domain
	scaling of the predicted multiples. We show that this scaling leads
	to successful estimation of primaries, despite amplitude, sign, timing,
	and phase errors in the predicted multiples. Our results on synthetic

	matching in terms of better suppression of multiple energy and high-frequency

	$Œî_p$ are robust to noise and stable in the sense that they are
	$(2, p)$ instance optimal. Second, we extend the results of Wojtaszczyk

  abstract = {Predictive multiple suppression methods consist of two main steps:
	a prediction step, during which multiples are predicted from seismic
	data, and a primary-multiple separation step, during which the predicted
	multiples are {\textquoteright}matched{\textquoteright} with the
	true multiples in the data and subsequently removed. This second
	separation step, which we will call the estimation step, is crucial
	in practice: an incorrect separation will cause residual multiple
	energy in the result or may lead to a distortion of the primaries,
	or both. To reduce these adverse effects, a new transformed-domain
	method is proposed where primaries and multiples are separated rather
	than matched. This separation is carried out on the basis of differences
	in the multiscale and multidirectional characteristics of these two
	signal components. Our method uses the curvelet transform, which
	maps multidimensional data volumes into almost orthogonal localized
	multidimensional prototype waveforms that vary in directional and
	spatio-temporal content. Primaries-only and multiples-only signal
	components are recovered from the total data volume by a non-linear
	optimization scheme that is stable under noisy input data. During
	the optimization, the two signal components are separated by enhancing
	sparseness (through weighted l1-norms) in the transformed domain
	subject to fitting the observed data as the sum of the separated
	components to within a user-defined tolerance level. Whenever, during
	the optimization, the estimates for the primaries in the transformed
	domain correlate with the predictions for the multiples, the recovery
	of the coefficients for the estimated primaries will be suppressed
	while for regions where the correlation is small the method seeks
	the sparsest set of coefficients that represent the estimation for
	the primaries. Our algorithm does not seek a matched filter and as
	such it differs fundamentally from traditional adaptive subtraction
	methods. The method derives its stability from the sparseness obtained
	by a non-parametric (i.e. not depending on a parametrized physical
	model) multiscale and multidirectional overcomplete signal representation.
	This sparsity serves as prior information and allows for a Bayesian
	interpretation of our method during which the log-likelihood function
	is minimized while the two signal components are assumed to be given
	by a superposition of prototype waveforms, drawn independently from
	a probability function that is weighted by the predicted primaries
	and multiples. In this paper, the predictions are based on the data-driven
	surface-related multiple elimination method. Synthetic and field
	data examples show a clean separation leading to a considerable improvement
	in multiple suppression compared to the conventional method of adaptive
	matched filtering. This improved separation translates into an improved
	stack.},

  abstract = {An explicit algorithm for the extrapolation of one-way wavefields
	is proposed that combines recent developments in information theory
	and theoretical signal processing with the physics of wave propagation.
	Because of excessive memory requirements, explicit formulations for
	wave propagation have proven to be a challenge in 3D. By using ideas
	from compressed sensing, we are able to formulate the (inverse) wavefield
	extrapolation problem on small subsets of the data volume, thereby
	reducing the size of the operators. Compressed sensing entails a
	new paradigm for signal recovery that provides conditions under which
	signals can be recovered from incomplete samplings by nonlinear recovery
	methods that promote sparsity of the to-be-recovered signal. According
	to this theory, signals can be successfully recovered when the measurement
	basis is incoherent with the representa-tion in which the wavefield
	is sparse. In this new approach, the eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz
	operator are recognized as a basis that is incoherent with curvelets
	that are known to compress seismic wavefields. By casting the wavefield
	extrapolation problem in this framework, wavefields can be successfully
	extrapolated in the modal domain, despite evanescent wave modes.
	The degree to which the wavefield can be recovered depends on the
	number of missing (evanescent) wavemodes and on the complexity of
	the wavefield. A proof of principle for the compressed sensing method
	is given for inverse wavefield extrapolation in 2D, together with
	a pathway to 3D during which the multiscale and multiangular properties
	of curvelets, in relation to the Helmholz operator, are exploited.
	The results show that our method is stable, has reduced dip limitations,
	and handles evanescent waves in inverse extrapolation. {\copyright}2007
